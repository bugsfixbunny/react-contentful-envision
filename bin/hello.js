const chalk = require('chalk');

console.log(`

${chalk.green('Hey there! ðŸ‘‹')}

${chalk.yellow.bold('yarn run setup')} automates the following steps for you:
  - creates a config file ${chalk.yellow('./.contentful.json')}
  - imports ${chalk.green('a predefined content model')}

When this is done run:

${chalk.yellow(
      'yarn run dev',
  )} to start a development environment at ${chalk.green('localhost:8000')}

or

${chalk.yellow(
      'yarn run build',
  )} to create a production ready static site in ${chalk.green('./public')}

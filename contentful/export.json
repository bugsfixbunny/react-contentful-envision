        },
        "body": {
          "en-US": "Transportation is a vital part of our lives. Without it, we can't do a large number of the things we do on a daily basis, such as getting groceries, or going to work. In this article, we plan to do a deep dive into how transportation will evolve and change for the year 2040. Overall, we expect change to come in 3 major categories, environmental impact/cleanliness, fuel efficiency, and fuel source.\n\n## Air Travel in 2040\n<img src=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/2018/January/white-plane-sky-xlarge.jpg\" alt=\"Airplane in the sky with clouds in the background\">\nCredit: Telegraph.co.uk\n\nIndustry analysts predict massive changes in the technology used to fly us around the world. Airplanes in 2040 will be faster, smarter, and better for the environment than what we use today. Futurist Ray Hammond predicts that airports will use facial recognition technology to improve the check in and security processes. Having software analyze and compare our faces with our passports will be significantly faster than having humans manually do the comparison. The facial recognition technology also opens the door to a completely automated check in process.\n\nAirplane technology will also see large improvements by the year 2040. In the next 10 years, supersonic jets are expected to return. Supersonic aircraft were prevalent in the past, but were phased due to cost inefficiencies. Fuel & maintenance costs, and lower capacities cost airline companies too much to continue using them when compared to larger capacity aircraft such as the Boeing 747. Modern supersonic jets such as the Boom XB1 are more efficient than their predecessors, and they will be much quieter as well. They will be able to carry more passengers and will burn less (and more eco-friendly) fuel, practically eliminating the original drawbacks to using supersonic jets.\n\nLastly, new energy sources such as biofuel and Hydrogen cells will be developed and in use by 2040. These new technologies will (hopefully) be more environmentally friendly than current fossil fuel based fuels, while still being equal in terms of energy capacity. Biofuel will likely be ready before Hydrogen cells, Boeing plans to convert their whole fleet to biofuel by 2030, and they’ve already done several successful test flights and demonstrations using biofuel. Hydrogen cells are the next step beyond biofuel, and they’re likely to be even more environmentally friendly & energy efficient than both biofuel and traditional fossil fuels. Airbus is collaborating with ElringKlinger to produce Hydrogen cell powered planes that could take flight as soon as 2035.\n\n## Trains & Subways\n<img src=\"https://www.gonomad.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/eurostar-on-board.jpg?_t=1521449308\" alt=\"Subway train in a train station\">\nCredit: Gonomad.com\n\nFollowing a similar pattern to air travel, traveling by train in 2040 will be faster, more efficient, and more eco-friendly. Over the past several years, new technologies such as the bullet train, and electricity-powered trains have emerged to improve transportation networks across the world. In the future, engineering group Arup predicts that scheduling systems and other functions will be automated. This would improve efficiency when plotting routes for individual trains, and it will improve the reliability of the trains by ensuring they reach their destinations on time. Arup also predicts that trains will be powered by liquified natural gas, Hydrogen, or Biofuel by 2050. This prediction mirrors the predictions made for airplanes, so there’s some consistency in the push for cleaner energy, which we feel is great.\n\nA prediction of our own is that we expect to see more railways built to utilize Maglev technology. Maglev is short for magnetic levitation, where the train “hovers” above the rails, suspended by magnetic forces.  Maglev trains seek to increase energy efficiency by eliminating the heat and friction generated by riding on a track. This saved energy is instead put towards better fuel efficiency, or increasing the speed of the train. Maglev trains are already used in several countries, most notably Japan, but we think they’ll see more use internationally as we push for greater efficiency and eco-friendliness.\n\nIn our section on aircraft, we discussed how Biofuel and Hydrogen cells are being developed to revolutionize energy storage. We believe that these technologies will also see their ways into powering trains and railway networks. When they are implemented, we expect many of the same benefits mentioned above, namely, less impact on the environment and better storage capabilities.\n\n## Automobiles\n<img src=\"https://www.iihs.org/api/ratings/model-year-images/2933\" alt=\"A Tesla Model 3.\">\nCredit: IIHS\n\nIn 2040, we expect automobiles to look pretty similar to how they do now. Chassis designs as a whole may be more aerodynamic, but they won’t be fundamentally different from what we already drive. The major differences between current vehicles and 2040’s vehicles will be found in the technology used. The number of sensors used in the average car is expected to drastically increase as technology advances and cars get “smarter.” The data pulled from these sensors can be utilized to automate driving. Several companies are working on autonomous driving technology, however they are only rated at level 2 at most. In 2040, we hope to see vehicles in levels 4 and 5, meaning the vehicles are almost completely autonomous or 100% self driving.\n\nElectricity-powered vehicles are the current trend. We believe that they will still be around in 2040, and they will make up a majority of vehicles sold, but we also expect to see alternate sources of energy being used. You may even be able to predict them. We believe that Biofuels may be used as an alternative to fossil fuels while better batteries for electric vehicles are developed, and eventually, Hydrogen cells will be used in place of both.\n\nAs a whole, we expect the number of motor vehicles on the road to decrease. More people will rely on public transportation, such as busses and trains, and some will switch to cleaner forms of transportation such as walking and biking. Ride sharing services will continue to increase to also help fill the gaps. A common prediction we like is that ride sharing services will eventually stop using human driven cars, and they will buy a fleet of autonomous vehicles to save on costs. \n\n## Conclusion\nWe're really excited to see what the world will look like in 2040, and we hope you are too. Thank you for your time, and thank you for reading our article.

          "en-US": "\n## Search for Bias\nPrior to the invention of the search engines like Google, Bing, or Yahoo, the process of digital information curation was a remarkably human intensive task. In the early days of the internet, people would manually go through and curate web links so that the process of accessing digital information was similar to going to your local library. In the current internet environment, how we access information has been left to remarkably complex algorithms of machines to make their own selections and prioritize search results. Unfortunately, there is a fundamental problem with modern search engines that is only expected to worsen as the tech behind it gets more complex: they are biased.\n\n## Math is Not Pure\nAt the heart of every search engine is algorithms and mathematical models. While you might think that math is neutral and these models are unbiased, you would be wrong.\n\nAccording to Cathy O'Neil, an American mathematician, data scientist, and award-winning author, in her 2016 book *Weapons of Math Destruction*:\n\n> The math-powered applications powering the data economy were based on choices made by fallible human beings. Some of these choices were no doubt made with the best intentions. Nevertheless, many of these models encoded human prejudice, misunderstanding, and bias into the software systems that increasingly managed our lives. Like gods, these mathematical models were opaque, their workings invisible to all but the highest priests in their domain: mathematicians and computer scientists. Their verdicts, even when wrong or harmful, were beyond dispute or appeal. And they tended to punish the poor and the oppressed in our society, while making the rich richer [[1]](#references).\n\nUnfortunately for the majority of us, we are not mathematicians and computer scientists. Being able to see whether or not a search engine is biased or expresses human prejudice is not readily apparent. However, once you start to see some of the ways that bias is perpetuated on search engines, it becomes easier to recognize it when you are going about your daily life.\n\n## Examples of Bias\nAlgorithms being biased might not seem like a big deal; So what, your search results do not give you what you want every so often. However, for communities and groups of people that already face heavy stereotyping, objectification, and discrimination, that bias is disastrous. Back in 2013, the United Nations in collaboration with the advertising agency [Memac Ogilvy & Mather Dubai started a campaign using \"genuine Google searches\"](https://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2013/10/women-should-ads) to bring attention to sexist and discriminatory patterns that emerged on Google's platform.\n\n![UN Women ad](//images.ctfassets.net/keiomil1rdyy/7dQlk6pIqEtAGYPzg55Hwe/2ad881f4988bf78eaf0f96b31dda46d1/un-women-ads_495x183_jpg.jpg)\n\n*Credit: Memac Ogilvy & Mather Dubai*\n\nThrough the campaign, they displayed a range of blatant sexist ideas that Google's autosuggestion feature displayed to users, including but not limited to:\n\n- Women cannot: drive, be bishops, be trusted, speak in church\n- Women should not: have rights, vote, work, box\n- Women should: stay at home, be slaves, be in the kitchen, not speak in church\n- Women need to: be put in their places, know their place, be controlled, be disciplined\n\nAt the time, the campaign suggested that search engines like Google mirror users' beliefs and indicated that society still holds a widearray of sexist ideas about women. The campaign, however, put the blame of the issue primarily on users and not the search engine itself. Though in the past several years since that campaign, Google has obviously gotten better with its autosuggestion feature and filtered out quite a lot the bias, but it does still exist.\n\nOnce you start searching on Google, it is shockingly easy to find areas of bias. For instance, as of writing this, if you search into Google 'beautiful', 40 out of the top 50 image results are woman. If you search 'professor' 42 of the top 50 image results are men. Again, if you search 'weight loss' 39 of the top 50 image results are women. Even though Google might not seem initially biased, it becomes increasingly clear that bias does exist as time goes on. You would have thought that in nearly a decade, Google would have made major strides to remove all bias but that is not the case. So, the question is, will search engines like Google get better at removing bias in the next 20 years? What are the consequences if they don't, and how can you learn to recognize this bias?\n\n## Consequences of Not Removing Bias\nRemoving all biases will not always be possible considering it would be nearly impossible to create a data set that represents the thoughts, opinions, and demographics of all people. By not taking this into account and moderating the bias that is multiplied within search engines and AI, future generations will become more and more influenced by the prejudice perpetuated by such technologies.\n\nRemoving bias in search algorithms will create more neutral results and equal standing for those using such algorithms. Ad targeting will only become more rampant as search engines pool biases and target the expected user. For a better experience on the web and for more relevant usage, bias must be watched for and removed.\n\n## How to Recognize Algorithmic Bias\nWhile search engines represent a large problem area for algorithmic bias, the increased use of artificial intelligence and machine learning tools presents another issue to watch out for as technology progresses. With large volumes of macro- and micro-data used by algorithms, decisions are influenced constantly surrounding a wide range of topics. That being said, algorithmic bias actually exists in the data itself. As the algorithm learns and adapts from data it is given, biases are formed and output to others in larger quantities.\n\nThe first step in removing these biases that influence us it to recognize the causes of bias and where they might be present. Historical biases against minorities and women should be watched for and recognized in data sets that help to train algorithms. There will be a trade off between fairness and accuracy when it comes to the ethics of algorithms that can be hard to recognize. Despite this, the core piece in recognizing algorithmic bias comes from properly assessing the data it is given for accurate representation. It's important to ask yourself \"who is the audience, and who benefits from these searches?\" AI and algorithms are not free from human judgements, so without moderation in search engines and other new technologies, bias will continue to be taught and spread.\n\n## Conclusion\nUltimately, while bias in search engines and algorithms is not always noticeable, it remains present and persistent to this day. Mathematical models are just as fallible to this biased data and require a watchful eye to recognize the unconcious or conscious bias that may be occurring. If bias is not removed from our search engines, prejudice and judgements will only continue to be perpetuated and targeted at users.\n\n## Takeaways\n- Bias in search engines and algorithms is not always noticeable; however, it remains present and persistent to this day.\n- Mathematical models are just as fallible to this biased data and require a watchful eye to recognize the unconcious or conscious bias that may be occurring.\n- If bias is not removed from our search engines, prejudice and judgements will only continue to be perpetuated and targeted at users.\n\n## Further Reading\n- [Why algorithms can be racist and sexist\n](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/2/18/21121286/algorithms-bias-discrimination-facial-recognition-transparency)\n- [This Film Examines the Biases in the Code That Runs Our Lives](https://www.wired.com/story/film-examines-biases-code-runs-our-lives/)\n- [Math Isn't Biased, But Big Data Is.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/metabrown/2017/08/30/math-isnt-biased-but-big-data-is/?sh=5a97b0284d56)\n\n<a name=\"references\"/></a>\n## References\n- [1] C.

For people with disabilities, technology makes things possible.\" - Mary Pat Radabaugh__*\n\n![wheelchairaccessibilityinkcartoon](//images.ctfassets.net/keiomil1rdyy/4Fg5jG1veZiruE0FHlZGus/df63cabcffdf53748edb8d8ed1b20785/wheelchairaccessibilityinkcartoon.png)\n\n### What Is Inaccessible?\n[8]![disability graphic](//images.ctfassets.net/keiomil1rdyy/k5GJnvL2RdqijCw0a6iKh/0476d81ce5f56734326d6ad01b54d5e9/How_Students_With_Disabilities_Are_Affected.PNG)\n\nPlaces like public libraries or recreation centers are public services, but close soon after the typical school or work 9 to 5 and are places of high risk for Covid-19. Access to the internet, which is where for most job applications the only way to apply, rely on people paying for their internet services. Schools are incorporating more and more technology into the classrooms, like laptops and tablets, and having readings and homework solely online. [[3, 7]](#references)\n\nThis isn’t some new phenomenon due to Covid-19, as early as 2012 [[6]](#references) there are notes on how it’s not just online only job applications, but an online social presence that many can’t afford. Things like networking on LinkedIn can give applicants a significant advantage that those without regular internet access can’t get. In 2011 62% of 1,055 presidents of colleges and universities used online textbooks.[[11]](#references) For some lucky college students they find themselves elibible to request and recieve financial aid, though most are currently only available due to Covid-19 such as the [Emergancy Broadband Benefit](https://www.fcc.gov/broadbandbenefit). [[4,5, 12]](#references) There were even bills introduced, not passed, in House in 2019 2020 to help keep the internet accessible for the public.[[13, 14, 15]](#references) \n\nThere are organizations such as the [National Digital Inclusion Alliance](https://www.digitalinclusion.org/publications/) that work to bridge that gap through providing technology training, publishing papers, and getting involved in policy writing. \n\n![National Digital Inclusion Alliance Infographic](//images.ctfassets.net/keiomil1rdyy/2dyRTT4wRxJGs5gtgC8YP7/d33d4445f2520844145f83b6db8118f4/NDIA-infographic-scaled.jpg)\n\nThis leads into the overlap concerning how important having the funds to access technologies with those physical and mental disabilities needing further technology or aids to access other aspects of life on top of that. Further increased by the issue that not everyone can afford the technology they need to accommodate their disability. Things like closed captions are becoming more common but you can probably think of at least a dozen YouTube videos with extremely inaccurate ones, there’s at least one entire channel dedicated to it. Alt text is also fairly commonly mentioned, but not implemented everywhere. Entrance ramps that are far out of the way. In summary, a lack of available options. \n\n__\"Accessible  ICT can level the playing field for persons with  disabilities  across  life  domains  including  education,  employment,  e-governance  and  civic participation, financial inclusion, and disaster management.\" - Deepti Samant Raja__ [6](#references)\n\nTeam meetings are meant to be a time to hash out problems and come up with solutions, but how inclusive are you being? Can everyone contribute? Are you understanding everyone? Can everyone understand you? [[1]](#references)\n\nIt takes effort to put in the necessary work and learn the skills to be inclusive and create an inclusive workspace. Doing that now makes a long term difference in the lives of everyone can benefit from being able to access what are regularly considered common resources.  \n\n### How to be Inclusive and Encourage that Inclusion\n\nWhen it comes to the workplace and instilling the practice of an inclusive environment for people with disabilities, different forms of communication are one way to achieve it. If we specifically reflect on the different types of meetings held within companies and schools for example, from the overall administrative team to the teams of smaller organizations or peer groups within the institute, we can begin to see some of the ways in which we can increase inclusivity. \n\nThe United Nations’ ESCAP [[1]](#references) wrote a document that sheds some light on how to have more disability-inclusive meetings. As an important foundation for constructing solutions as we dive in to some insights from ESCAP and others, let us reiterate what the actual issue is: that people with disabilities face a barrier(s) such that it will require some creative and considerate thinking from all involved persons in the organization to help their participation in meetings to be more effective and almost seamless. \n\nAt times, it seems like “one-size fits all” solution, but it is encouraged that one take these insights as a way to be able to construct a solution of one’s own according to unique scenarios. [[1]](#references) A critical next step is to reflect on ourselves as individuals. What have we personally done in meetings with these persons, whether brief or long, to be simply considerate or help accelerate the needed accommodations, so the focus can be on the topic being discussed? Can we truly say we are working as a team to increase the company or school’s success when we have issues from within the structure such disability-inclusivity that we are seemingly timid in addressing? In the  big picture, if we do not allow for our environment to be one that is truly striving toward inclusivity, can we truly say that we’re nearing our highest potential as an organization?\n\nTo encourage more accessible environments, it is important to recognize that some disabilities may not be as visible, so while it is easy to say that the meeting room will have the proper equipment to accommodate those who use wheelchairs for example, what are some more specialized and indicative ways that accessibility can be instilled? When we consider what the UNESCAP’s document says are four critical areas of accessibility:The physical environment, transportation, information and communications, and other facilities and services open to the public [[1]](#references). What are some of the areas that may need some more attention? \n\n## Why We Care\nFrom our everyday lives to the workplace, there is not a place where technology does not often influence us especially in the US. Ensuring and reinforcing accessible technologies such as with the internet, videos, and the various digital tools involved to operate them, allows for victories over barriers and walls that prevent people with disabilities from reaching their fullest capabilities and from participating in a valuable way to society [[9]](#references). Innovative thinking is being lost and hidden in the shadows of our inability to see possibilities of looking past ourselves, especially if we are able-bodied. Despite how far we have come in understanding people, and though there are laws in place to promote this topic, from a sociological standpoint, it seems as though we, as a society, made it a norm to show some deviance in seeing it as enough to implement an obvious accessible technology for the sake of the law and turn a blind eye to what more could be done. It will not only be to the advantage of people with disabilities to avidly uphold the accessibility standards set by the government through the ADA laws but also to us as it means a chance to collaborate with more diverse groups and add to our knowledge in order to advance society for the better [[9]](#references). According to Baker’s “Making Technology Accessible to Everyone,” one in four adults experience a disability and about 70% of users discontinue using a website that is difficult to navigate [[10]](#references). More consideration towards this subject would hopefully decrease the attitude of ritualism that also tends to be a side effect of the process of providing aid to people with disabilities. \n\n![inclusivemeeting](//images.ctfassets.net/keiomil1rdyy/4Oak9f7MMtmnbnbDYr3Wep/7ca372e062fbf552754ce88eb55d16a3/inclusivemeeting.png)\n\n## Takeaways\n- The accessible technology may be available, but how much time is spent talking about them versus taking the steps to have them implemented and used in a routine manner as needed? \n- The circumstances of a disability vary. What are we doing now to ready ourselves for unexpected circumstances that might force as to revisit the idea of inclusivity and being able to play a role in society despite the timid attitude toward the subject.\n- To reiterate, how far have we come in increasing accessibility for as many     people as possible and how much farther could we go?\n\n## Further Reading\n- [Kat Boogaard's *How to Make Your Workplace More Accessbile to People With Disabilites*](https://www.themuse.com/advice/how-to-create-an-accessible-workplace)\n- [TeachAccess](https://teachaccess.org/about/faq/)\n- [Assistive Technology Solutions](https://atsolutions.org)\n- [*Lack of Internet Access Has Become Critical for Students*](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/alabama/articles/2020-09-19/lack-of-internet-access-has-become-critical-for-students)\n- [United States Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=Arkansas%20internet&g=0400000US05&tid=ACSST1Y2018.S2801&hidePreview=true) \n- [Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/10/28/5-leading-concerns-about-the-future-of-digital-life/) \n\n<a name=\"references\"/></a>\n## References\n- [[1] United Nations ESCAP's *Disability Inclusive Meetings: An Operational Guide*](https://www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/Disability%20Inclusive%20Meetings%20PDF.pdf)\n- [[2] Suman Damera's *Tips for Creating an Accessible Workplace*](https://www.deque.com/blog/tips-for-creating-an-accessible-workplace/)\n- [[3] Emily Tate's *Covid-19 has Widened the 'Homework Gap' Into a Full-Fledged Learning Gap*](https://www.edsurge.com/news/2020-06-16-covid-19-has-widened-the-homework-gap-into-a-full-fledged-learning-gap)\n- [[4] Patrick Roney's *Students concerned with lack of internet access, job security in light of online transition* ](https://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2020/03/students-concerned-with-lack-of-internet-access-job-security-in-light-of-online-transition)\n- [[5] National Digital Inclusion Alliance](https://www.digitalinclusion.org/about-ndia/)\n- [[6] Deepti Samanta Raja's *Bridging the Disability Divide through Digital Technologies* for the World Bank Group](http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/123481461249337484/WDR16-BP-Bridging-the-Disability-Divide-through-Digital-Technology-RAJA.pdf)\n- [[7] U.S. Department of Education](https://www.ed.gov/oii-news/use-technology-teaching-and-learning/)\n- [[8] Mark Lieberman's *Technology Can Address Digital Accessibility -- to an Extent*](https://www.insidehighered.com/digital-learning/article/2018/05/02/technology-can-help-address-accessibility-challenges-many-say)\n- [[9] Accessible Technology in the Workplace](https://accessibletech.org/accessible-technology/)\n- [[10] Bekah Baker's *Making Technology Accessible to Everyone*](https://medium.com/cratebind/making-technology-accessible-to-everyone-1606d9746a51)\n- [[11] Pew Research Center, Kim Parker and Amanda Lenhart's *The Digital Revolution and Higher Education*](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2011/08/28/the-digital-revolution-and-higher-education/)\n- [[12] National Center for Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2017/2017098/index.asp) \n- [[13] Accessible, Affordable Internet for All Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/4131)\n- [[14] Supporting Connectivity for Higher Education Students in Need Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/3701/related-bills) \n- [[15] Community Broadband Act of 2019](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2785)"

          "en-US": "## Why Is Looking at the Diversity & Inclusion Demographics Important?\nWe all know the benefits of Diversity and Inclusion in the working environment. However, a study revealed that more than 57% of the employees want companies to improve Diversity and Inclusion among the workforce. So why do people feel that companies and organizations are not doing a good job of encouraging diversity?\n\nIn reality, managing a diverse workforce is challenging because each demographic traits such as gender, race, age, etc. each face unique challenges. Reflecting on the demographics, companies can reflect if they are managing the diversity and inlusion effectively or not. If not, they can start the recommended practices to improve the diversity (ex. build a culture of respecting diversity, create diversity training programs, review recruitment practices, etc.)¹\n\n## Demographics, Diversity & Inclusion\n![D&I demographics](//images.ctfassets.net/keiomil1rdyy/1xMEgu9IIQC1xoe9V2NhxU/a255ca79ca5ad2bdeb2ee0b9ff11a86f/DIVERSITY___INCLUSION_DEMOGRAPHICS.png)\n\n## Takeaways\n- The demographics will only be the catalyst for change in behavior and\npractices to improve our current situation of Diversity and Inclusion. To make it come true, we all have to start planning, act now, and be comfortable with the changes ahead.\n- Without accountability, Diversity and Inclusion efforts won’t hold. The missing ingredient for most solid D&I plans is that there are no repercussions for not hitting the goals.\n\n<a name=\"further reading\"/></a>\n## Further Reading\n- [How the end of the white majority could change office dynamics in 2040](https://www.fastcompany.com/90450018/how-the-end-of-the-white-majority-could-change-office-dynamics-in-2040)\n- [Americans are more positive about the long-term rise in U.S. racial and ethnic diversity than in 2016](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/10/01/americans-are-more-positive-about-the-long-term-rise-in-u-s-racial-and-ethnic-diversity-than-in-2016/)\n- [States of Change.

          "en-US": "## Importance of Technology in Medicine \nWhy should people be concerned about the influence of technology in the medical field? It's not a question that takes a lot of convincing. The importance of medicine in our society is crucial to everyone and the increased potential for care should be prioritized by everyone. At one point or another, we are all going to need medical care and make decisions about our care which is why it is important to understand the influence that technology can have in medicine. \n\n## Medicine as a Creative Industry\nMedicine is usually thought of as a hard science with data and evidence to drive breakthroughs and treatments. The clash and intersection with technology will soon allow for more creative minds to impact medicine in a positive way. Technological tools are paving the way for medical professionals to perform their jobs more efficiently and effectively than before as well as providing them with capabilities that they would not normally have without the assistance of technology. With the adoption of more and more technology into the medical field, we will see more innovation to assist professionals. [[1]](#references)\n![creative technology](//images.ctfassets.net/keiomil1rdyy/5OH1rIzqSlWW0T9c0jgLlP/06f7f1527c39b6fe9884b9ac6a669438/creative.jpeg)\n\nThis doesn't come without its risks. We see that in many cases that technology is involved, there are bugs and issues associated with it. The last place we need to call tech support is on the operating table or on a ventilator. It is important to create rigorous regulations for medical technology to pass in order to ensure the safety and confidentiality of patients. Clear development procedures should be in place to weed out issues in software that could be life threatening. Along with all of this we will still have to train doctors to perform their duties without the use of technology for those unwilling to be treated in that way. \n\n## Machine Learning and Medicine\nOften times doctors run into difficult situations during the diagnosis of illnesses in patients. With the future development of machine learning, they are likely to have assistance when making a diagnosis. \n![machineLearning](//images.ctfassets.net/keiomil1rdyy/78T4R9WXVQadUODOl0xuwT/1d0ef27b6bab951fa26a793754f4af32/machineLearning.jpeg)\n\nMachine learning involves taking data from thousands or hundreds of thousands of records to predict outcomes based on certain indicators in the data. In the future, having machines predict a diagnosis based on a patient's current data pitted against what it knows already could prove to be more accurate than a doctor's diagnosis. \n\nThis may sound like a fantastic innovation until we look deeper into the ethical implications imposed on medical professionals and what they are supposed to do with this information. What if the machine comes to a different conclusion than the doctor? Are they going to throw out all of their years of experience because a program said otherwise? What if they are wrong? What if the machine is wrong? Who is at fault for a misdiagnosis? The prominence that machine learning will have introduces new ethical dilemmas into this field that should have appropriate rules and regulations that people can follow. \n\n## Medicine and Privacy\nOn May 27th, 2017, the WanaCry virus began to spread and infect over 300,000 devices in a matter of days. The ransomware utilized the EternalBlue exploit to hold digital data for ransom costing an estimated $8 Billion globally. [[2]](#references)\n\n2 years later, almost 40% of healthcare organizations were still dealing with the intrusion of the virus. One of the most legally protected forms of data in the United States is medical data. With the introduction of the cloud and alternative forms of storage for healthcare organizations, the risk of security breaches has increased exponentially. \n![privacy](//images.ctfassets.net/keiomil1rdyy/XyyI9XLfkt2rxNx7EOEy5/6095892ed3b7f19bff264186d8464a63/privacy.jpeg)\n\nThe field of cyber security is an ongoing battle between those seeking to find information they don't have access to and those seeking to protect it. As we introduce medical data to the internet through innovative technology like the cloud and IoT, we run the risk of compromising people's medical records. \n\nThe most important step to mitigating these security risks is involve the education of those involved in the implementation of technology in healthcare organizations about the risks associated with said technology. Combining their tacit knowledge with knowledge of vulnerabilities in software will allow them to perform appropriate risk analysis on the situation to protect our information. \n\n## Takeaways\n- As exciting and innovative as it sounds to introduce the medical field to   the bleeding edge of technological advancement, it is important to weigh     the risks associated with it. \n- Right now we need to forecast the impacts that technology could have on     this field and begin to have conversations about the costs and benefits of   implementation. \n- Technology advances exponentially and it is best to stay ahead of the       curve in order to avoid any missed risks falling through the cracks and     causing the loss of life or privacy. \n\n## Further Reading\n- [Current Deep Learning on Medical Scans ](https://nanonets.com/blog/deep-learning-for-medical-imaging/) \n- [Current Security Threats in Healthcare Industry](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topic/top-cyber-security-risks-healthcare/)\n\n<a name=\"references\"/></a>\n## References\n- [1] “The creative intersection of medicine and technology,” Hcinnovationgroup.com, 10-Nov-2014.

          "en-US": "We’re currently seeing how technology is becoming more and more prevalent in education through remote learning.  You can take a class from any part of the world.  A speaker doesn’t have to physically come to you.  There’s a lot of possibilities and opportunities you didn’t have before.  In the future, there will be even more drastic evolution in technology.  Teachers and students will have a wider variety of tools to aid with learning.\n\n## Personalization\nEducation will be more personalized through technology.  Updating what and how students learn is crucial for schools and colleges.  In a Trends Shaping Education report, 1400 educators were surveyed and most say that education will be centered around personalized and self-paced learning in the future.  Artificial intelligence, chatbots, video learning will be used more and more. \n\nEach student has more power over what and how they learn.  According to the Center for Digital Education, the number one educational technology priority is personalized learning.  What exactly is personalized learning?  Using software so students can go through material at their own pace.  Students can then either remediate if needed or accelerate.  This would move learning from fixed-paced to mastery-based meaning students move on when they’re ready.\n\n![Classrooms of the Future](//images.ctfassets.net/keiomil1rdyy/ciWKEz48sekyBZjX1gaTv/73dd45f1a0e8de039fb18b2f92890cf8/Classrooms_of_the_Future_graphic.jpg)\nFrom Best Education Degrees\n\n## Artificial Intelligence\nAI has an impact on all industries, but although education is a field that isn’t normally linked to AI, it’s embracing applications of AI.  Duolingo, an app for learning languages, has been downloaded by millions of people and it is AI-powered.  This challenges traditional learning.  Chatbots also provide interaction between student and computer and allow for feedback and self-paced learning.  In terms of feedback, students will improve more by getting feedback immediately rather than having to wait.  Student performance can also be tracked, and the curriculum can match the student’s needs.  AI is engaging and can make learning more effective, while also assisting teachers.\n\nEducation is often looked at as more rigid and reluctant to change, but AI technology has great potential for educational uses.  Traditional education systems come with limitations and AI eliminates boundaries making learning more accessible.  AI helps transform into the personalized learning experience.  Students’ learning can be adapted based on their abilities, preferences, and learning styles.  AI can also give students extra support by using educational assistants that answer questions and provide information.  This can be very helpful for teachers as well in terms of their administrative tasks, such as organizing material, grading, managing paperwork.  \n\n> \"The future will be about pairing the artificial intelligence of computers with the cognitive, social and emotional capabilities of humans, so that we educate first-class humans, not second-class robots”\n—OECD, Trends Shaping Education report\n\n## Virtual Reality\nVirtual reality has grown a lot within gaming but will also be used more and more for educational purposes.  It is a great engaging learning tool, similar to AI.  Students can experience what they’re learning about.  Accessibility is what will make widespread use possible.  One example is a virtual science lab which makes it possible for students to perform lab experiments without the risk of any harm.  This can also allow students and scientists to experiment with more ease than before.  Students being able to interact in virtual 3D worlds enhances their learning experience.  There are many educational applications of VR, including things from virtual dissection to exploring historical moments which is like travelling without leaving the classroom.\n\nThere are many different learning styles, including verbal, visual, auditory, and physical, and each student has some that are most useful for them.  VR tools help bring the learning closer to students’ interests and adjust with learning styles.  Teachers can struggle with gaining and maintaining the attention of students, as students have trouble concentrating and staying focused, and VR helps with this.  VR gets students to interact with their studies and it’s more immersive and engaging.  On average, students can remember about 20% of what they see and 30% of what they hear, but statistics show that with learning through experience, students remember 90% of the material, so VR is improving the process of learning.\n\n![Student using VR](//images.ctfassets.net/keiomil1rdyy/1BcDz8mmmK4Dn3O88l5ezb/c3ed727f3bd5312795416fec946db3ab/Virtual_Reality_student.jpg)\n\n## Assistive Technology\nNew technology will put students with disabilities on more equal footing with their classmates.  The National Center for Education Statistics states that about 13% of students enrolled in public schools receive special education services.  Educational support needed can be provided through assistive technology devices, such as alternative input devices and speech-to-text technology.  Alternative input devices are an important education trend and closes the gap of students’ ability to learn.\n\nVR helps create a more inclusive classroom, helping those with disabilities regulate their devices and not be as left out in class.  VR augmented aid can help students with visual impairments and there’s some VR technology that translates sign language into human speech. \n\n## Adapting to Change\nIt’s important for students to have the ability to navigate changes.  Tech advancements will allow educators to teach more effectively and students to learn more effectively, but the concern comes in learning how to use them.  New innovations come with the need to learn, and it will become more and more important to have the ability to continue learning new skills.

Our connection and collaboration with others allowed us to survive in the early days of man. Though separated by masses of land, different cultures created their own way of communication. Inventing gestures, symbols, sounds, languages, alphabets, written word to communicate ideas and to create shared understanding. We express ourselves and bond over our shared human experiences. Our communication evolved with our new tools and technology but also allowed for new tools and technology to thrive. Passing on stories and knowledge. Vast sharing of ideas and critiques. Exchanging of languages and learning new ones. Communication is what makes us human. We’ve had letters and printing, telephones and operators, fax machines, mobile phones, email, text messaging, and now we basically carry a little computer around in our pocket that can connect us to a network of people across the globe. That’s extraordinary don’t you think?\n\n## Where are we?\nWe live in a world where we are now more connected than ever but can feel suffocating isolation at the same time. Technology has made great strides with communication in breadth but is now lacking in depth. We can call people all over the globe. We can hold video conferencing in place of in-person meetings. We can quickly message each other in seconds. We can have more followers than you have ever encountered and have influence. We have a catalog of our internet lives at our fingertips, but are we having meaningful interaction? \n\nReading text messages are cold and most people would rather have a text conversation than talking to someone because they are worried about not having the backspace. We can sit in a room and engage with the world on your phone instead of with the people beside you. It feels as though the internet lifeline and constant bombarding stream of information is more important than a genuine conversation. Communication isn’t just releasing content into the world to be received by many, it is finding the right words, giving full undivided attention, eye-contact, body-language, and expression. Our current technology encourages rough draft thoughts over baffling insights. We are looking for a quick read and to move on even when we have the time to scroll for hours anyways. [[19]](#reference)\n\nOur current technology has allowed for fast communication and second thoughts to allow your best self to be shown, but it feels lifeless. In the next two decades and beyond, we need new technology to recapture the meaning of communication.\n\n## Where are we going?\n\n### AR\n![Spatial](//images.ctfassets.net/keiomil1rdyy/4dWhgIj9UKQugybPWmibx9/a95b89a164e5b9402ec8c85c48d535fe/giphy.gif)\n*Credit: Spatial*\n\n__Applications__\n\nA mass amount of people are already using AR in their daily lives. It's used in many apps like Snapchat and Pokémon Go. It’s used in advertising on furniture websites so you can visualize what that couch looks like in your own living room before committing to it. But AR could be pushed further with wider integration of its technology.\n\nAR is the intersection point between our world and the digital one. It enhances what we can already see and touch around us and can provide more interaction with our world.[[1]](#reference) It can be used to show the history of an object by looking at it[[2]](#reference), animate still life pictures, and leave a digital footprint in the real world for someone else to discover.[[1]](#reference) It can transport a person into your own space and collaborate in a digital space.[[10][18]](#reference) This is human-centered technology.\n\n__Interaction__\n\nAR can increase our physical interaction with the world and with one another as it just enhances what is already there. With AR, we can explore the world outside and gather new information in a heads-up display. You can create new worlds on top of your own for you and others to enjoy. You can virtually invite someone over to your house and have it be similar to the real thing in every way except physical. We can start to have real conversations with people again while seeing their body language and their facial expressions. Video conferencing ultimately fails because it doesn’t allow for “presence” in a shared space, meanwhile AR can provide that and more.\n\n### VR\n![Codec Avatar](//images.ctfassets.net/keiomil1rdyy/VaQplxuJpyxyqYnNMAlAD/a058c4330206412ccf28d0a87262c920/Codec-2520Avatar_progression.gif)\n*Credit: Facebook Reality Labs*\n\n__Applications__\n\nMany people think of video games when they think of VR. While that is currently a primary use for VR, I believe that VR will become more widely integrated into everyday use. VR has the ability to completely transport us into another world, another life, another story. This is extremely powerful. It can be used for video games yes, but it can be used for so much more than that. It can be used as an art form[[14]](#reference), a story telling device[[13]](#reference), a news outlet,[[15]](#reference) the front row to a concert or a sports game, a 360˚ documentary of a war zone or of refugees,[[6][13]](#reference) or to experience being another person. [[6]](#reference)\n\n__Interaction__\n\nVR allows us to bridge the gap between reading or hearing something or looking at a picture and trying to piece together our own ideas and experiences to try to understand the content and context, and to experience it instead in real time. Instead “your consciousness is the medium” in which you can gather new information [[13]](#reference). Being placed into a new story can help us to build empathy for those who actually live in these situations.\n\nBesides creating a better understanding of others which I believe is one of the most important parts of connection, VR allows you to communicate verbally and physically. You can meet with others inside the virtual world. You can explore other worlds or planets together, solve puzzles and collaborate, or just sit down by a fake fire under a breathtaking view of uninhibited stars and have deep conversation without outside distractions. You are taken out of the current world of nonstop information and placed into a new one to truly bond with others. Technology is also being developed to export your entire body and face into a light-weight realistic 3D model that can fully capture your expressions while you emote them.[[4][17]](#reference)\n\n## What does it all mean?\nWhy is this next evolution of technology so important? It brings back communication between people in a human centered way. For so long we have been stuck with technology we have to adapt to in order to express ourselves virtually to others. We have been trapped in this 2D space where we don’t fully realize what others want us to experience. We accommodated computers for way to long and instead we should be able to interact with each other and our environment naturally and let the computers handle the rest. What will this new technology bring with it?\n\n### Curiosity\nUntil AR and VR, in order to experience something new, you had to either experience it firsthand or imagine it through words, pictures or film. Some things you just may have never known what it would be like. With AR and VR you can be immersed into the experience. You can discover new creatures from remote parts of the world and actually see their scale compared to yourself, traverse cities and landscapes that exist or visit ones that don’t, or live the life of your role model. This new technology can open up our own curiosities and allow us to pursue it without limits.[[7]](#reference)\n\n### Collaboration\nEmail is impossible when it comes to collaboration. There are more and more applications that allow for easier collaboration like Slack, Google Drive, and Box, but you can still feel disconnected in the online space and type over each other when working in the same document. You can have a meeting in person, but then it feels like not everyone has the power to contribute. With this new technology, everyone has the power to add, markup, and archive. Decisions and notes can also be kept in that virtual space so they can be brought back up again at a later time or sent off to another team to work on. It was also discovered that height difference could affect one’s confidence to speak up but in a virtual world, everyone is on level ground. [[10][18]](#reference)\n\n### Connection\nFinally, the most important need for this technology is connection to others. We have too many empty conversations passed over text message and the only deep connections we can make with each other is in-person. If we want to all become closer, we need to have these deep connections even over distances. This technology can bridge the gap between us and provide a better atmosphere for conversation. AR and VR can help create this new era of empathy and we can all understand each other a little better.\n\n## Takeaways\n- Technology has allow us to communicate with others all over the world but it still hasn't fully captured the experience of human interaction. AR and VR are the next steps to achieving this dream.\n- Curiosity: AR and VR will grant people the ability to explore their curiosities and learn together with others.\n- Collaboration: AR and VR will create a better space for collaboration where everyone is on a level playing field and it automatically saves important contributions.\n- Connection: AR and VR will allow for a deeper connection than text, email, or even video conferencing. It will display facial expressions, body language, and develop a better sense of presence.\n\n## Futher Reading\n- [A New Possibility Frontier](https://main.envision2040.com/human-interaction/a-new-possibility-frontier/ \"A New Possibility Frontier\")\n- [How To Embrace Future Technology?](https://main.envision2040.com/technology/embrace-tech/ \"How To Embrace Future Technology?\")\n\n<a name=\"reference\"/></a>\n## References\n- [1] G.

According to a Tallo survey [[1]](#references) of over 5,000 participants, 69% of Gen Z would “absolutely” be more likely to apply for a job that had recruiters and materials that reflected an ethnically and racially diverse workplace. An additional 21% said they would “probably” be more likely to apply. Leaders in 2040 wil demand inclusion.\n\n## Experiences\nThe traits that characterize each generation are not just trends or random occurences. Instead, each generation is a product of their experience; their norms shape a lens for understanding the world around. The most easily influenced period of one's life, give or take, is from age 5 to 20. Therefore, Gen X might have been shaped by the tail end of the Cold War. Milennials might have been influenced by the rise of video games, computers, and the events of 9/11. Gen Z is still at an easily influenced age today. You might ask, \"What are some norms that are influencing Gen Z as we speak that could possibly define them as a generation?\" \n\nThe first one would be the United States presidency. Take an older member of Gen Z for example. She would be roughly 20 years old. For 8 years of her life, Barack Obama was the President. For the next 4 years, Kamala Harris will be the Vice President. Therefore by the time she turns 24, there was a person of color in the White House. If it is ingrained in this generation's mind that diversity in the most powerful office in the nation is normal, how normal will it seem to have diversity in the most powerful office in your company?\n\nThe second example would be women in education. According to Pew Research [[2]](#references), there are currently more women than men in college. Furthermore, women have just recently closed the gap in the college-educated workforce [[3]](#references). More women with college educations will necessarily drive more women into executive offices. Another supporting argument is purely from this author's experience and has no research data to back it up. Let's just say that if women do most or all of the work in group projects while they're in college now, in 20 years they are probably going to be the ones doing all the work from a corner office with a view.\n\n## Seeing and Hearing Others\nAt the heart of social media and networking in general is the desire to share yourself, learn about others, and ultimately give everyone a voice. Gen Z knows this and they’ve earned the title “Cummunaholics.”  The ability to contribute to and learn from the world wide web is not hindered by socioeconomic status, geographic location, ethnic background, or the like. Taking advantage of this open source of seemingly infinite knowledge, Gen Z has seen and heard stories, lifestyles, and hardships from people of many different backgrounds. They have grown up in a world where “seeing things from a different perspective” is a reality. \n\n## Including this Diverse Workforce\nThe next 20 years will be imperative when it comes to bridging the gap between Gen Z and the rest of the workforce. Not only does Gen Z carry an inclusive attitude, but it will be the most racially and ethnically diverse generation the US has seen. Companies will have to learn how to cooperate with this generation or face the consequences of “Cancel Culture.” No list of “Top Ten Ways to Make Your Workplace More Inclusive” will cut it. Checking boxes off a to do list can be immediately identified and snuffed out as insincere. \n\nEnter stereotype threat. Everyone knows what a stereotype is; it is an assumption made about a person based on a demographic (age, gender, race, etc.). Stereotype threat is more so the effects of a stereotype on a person. When a group’s performance, character, or identity can be defined by a widely accepted stereotype, a member of that group will feel the pressure not to conform to that stereotype—whether it’s consciously or unconsciously. This could be a white person feeling the pressure to prove herself as an athlete; a black person to show she is just as smart as a white person; or an elderly person proving she is just as relevant as a Millennial. People under this stereotype are on high alert looking for indications of whether or not they fit in. This is where business executives can step up. Taking intentional steps to identify and eliminate these threats no matter how small will not go unnoticed and will ultimately foster an inclusive culture.\n\nBelow is a discussion with the leading expert on stereotype threat, Dr. Claude M. Steele [[A]](#further reading).\n\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\">\n<iframe\nclass=\"embed-responsive-item\"\nsrc=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/failylROnrY\"\nwidth=\"160\"\nheight=\"90\"/>\n</iframe>\n</div>\n\n*Dr. Claude M. Steele discusses the main insights of his research on stereotype threat.*\n\n## Gentelligence\n[Dr. Megan Gerhardt](https://thegerhardtgroup.com/about-us/ \"The Gerhardt Group\") from Miami University began the Gentelligence movement in 2017. The goal of this movement is to recognize that generational bias is one of the last acceptable biases and that it needs to end. She is releasing a book titled *Gentelligence: The Revolutionary Approach to Leading an Intergenerational Workforce* [[B]](#further reading) on June 8th, 2021. Below is an in-depth interview with Dr. Gerhardt on her research. \n\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\">\n<iframe\nclass=\"embed-responsive-item\"\nsrc=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_L0MqAftY2E\"\nwidth=\"160\"\nheight=\"90\"/>\n</iframe>\n</div>\n\n*An in-depth interview with Megan Gerhardt, PhD., expert on intergenerational diversity. Below is a brief synopsis of key insights from this interview.*\n\n## “New Collar” Career Paths\nEach generation has one or more shared, influential experiences that occur from about 5-20 years old; after all, this age range is when our character is shaped the most. That experience for Gen Z will be the COVID-19 pandemic. They have experienced online learning and to a certain degree had to learn how to teach themselves. The economy dipped, and their parents’ jobs were at risk. A lot of older Gen Z students questioned if college was a smart financial investment. Google rolled out their new [Career Certification](https://grow.google/certificates/?utm_source=gDigital&utm_medium=paidha&utm_campaign=sem-bk-gen-exa-glp-br&utm_term=google%20career%20certificates&gclid=Cj0KCQjw0caCBhCIARIsAGAfuMxc5kKGZn7ziPrd9V0mG8mDlVUPsGvzoNBL9F0zm9viGOwLCHLY6R8aAmAIEALw_wcB#?modal_active=none \"Google Career Certification\"); this training is meant to replace traditional training at a university. Gen Z knows that top tech companies aren’t necessarily looking for college degrees. They want employees who excel at what they do. Consequently, essential trades such as welding and plumbing are becoming a higher demand. Most of the employees in this industry are on the verge of retirement, and many young people are looking to take advantage of that.\n\n## Working with Generation Z\nAs Gen Z moves into the corporate world, we’re not going to see as much of a struggle for power as much as we are a struggle for knowledge. Traditionally, knowledge and wisdom were held most prominently by older generations. These generations have been in the field of work for the better part of their lives. In a premodern setting, this sets up a clear hierarchy. Moving forward in the next 20 years, we are going to see that ideology flipped on its head. Our youngest generation is fluent in computer skills and how they work. The infinite knowledge of the world wide web has always been at their fingertips. Even new computer skills are easily understood because the learning curve is significantly lower. So what will come of this struggle for knowledge?\n\nThe key here is that it is not a competition. Companies that want to rise above the rest will have to learn how to create synergy between multiple generations. This is accomplished when younger generations respect the long-term experience of their elders and older generations respect the innovative ideas of these new-comers. The biggest obstacles to accomplishing this goal fall under intergenerational stereotypes and biases. We fail to understand each others’ influential experiences, and we fail to remember that we’re all on the same team with fairly similar motives.\n\n## Takeaways\n- Seeing and hearing others' stories on a global scale is an everyday reality for Generation Z. This norm paired with current attitudes primes this generation to take on diversity and inclusion from a whole new perspective.\n- Stereotype threat is the pressure added to someone who could possibly be described by a negative stereotype. This perceived threat, concious or unconcious, significantly hinders one's performance. Intentionally removing stereotype threat cues is a tangible, important, and noticeable first step to foster inclusion.\n- Generational bias is perhaps one of the last acceptable biases of our time. As the age of the workforce increases with medical advnaces, we will only see an increase in generational diversity in the next 20 years. The main roadblocks to intergenerational synergy center around a lack of understanding of each others' circumstances and upbringing. At the end of the day, everyone in the office is on the same team and probably have very similar goals, even when it doesn't feel like it.\n\n<a name=\"further reading\"/></a>\n## Further Reading\n- [\"Whistling Vivaldi from Amazon\"  Steele, Claude M. *Whistling Vivaldi: How Stereotypes Affect Us and What We Can Do.* Reprint Edition, W.

          "en-US": "## What is an Ally?\nAccording to Webster’s dictionary, an ally is “one that is associated with another as a helper: a person or group that provides assistance and support in an ongoing effort, activity or struggle'' [[1]](#references). By this definition, being an ally goes way beyond accepting people of different races, abilities, genders or sexualities. Being an ally is about providing support, acceptance and understanding to all people regardless of their identities. Allyship is becoming increasingly important in the workplace; as the population demographics change (See: [How to be Inclusive](https://main.envision2040.com/modules/inclusive)), it is important to consider how to best make a comfortable work environment for everyone. Having mutual respect and acting as an ally is essential to both majority and minority groups in order to have open conversations, challenge ideas, and be efficient and productive in the workplace. The more comfortable, safe and confident that a person feels in the workplace, the more likely they are to contribute to projects and put forth their best effort.\n\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\">\n<iframe\nclass=\"embed-responsive-item\"\nsrc=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BPwdhMVIRNg\"\nwidth=\"160\"![watch?v=BPwdhMVIRNg](//assets.ctfassets.net/keiomil1rdyy/NtrAOsz9vcJ8cseFZBykm/b85dce8d5093ca8d764ffcf2f8c0f9fa/watch)\nheight=\"90\"/>\n</iframe>\n</div>\n\nIn an ideal world, everyone would treat each other with respect and dignity, and people would be allies to every person they encountered, yet this is not the case. There are several factors- some subconscious, that prevent us from being the best and most accepting allies we can be. Bias, which is any type of preconceived notion about a person or group, is inherently not a bad thing. We all have biases and preferences that are not harmful so long as they are acknowledged and managed. Some common hindrances to being a strong ally are: \n![Common Hindrances](//images.ctfassets.net/keiomil1rdyy/8X62ty7i9Y66adYxGYvKQ/b55b7bb584e239fbc2a8917d6b227d50/Common_Hindrances.png)\nThese hindrances are often the root of the most common issues in the workplace.  It is important to take the time to learn and understand how each of these may be affecting our work environments  and behaviors.\n\n__After reading these definitions, take the race implicit bias test to see if you have hidden preferences that you should consider moving forward.__\n\n[![Implicit Bias Banner](//images.ctfassets.net/keiomil1rdyy/7xzi2EzLzyb16iRQap5DYp/0d4043efc0155d4eaf875698dabaf097/Implicit_Bias_Test_Banner.png)](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html)\n\n## Implicit Bias Test Results\nNow that you have received your results from the Implicit Bias Test, consider if your results make sense. We tend to believe that we are bias-free, but in all actuality very few of us are truly impartial. Find your result below to see how to interpret and act on your results:\n\n__No Preference__\n\nThis is a great start to having an open mind and being a DEI leader in the workplace!  Having little to no racial bias is a very strong quality to have, yet it does not mean you do not have more work still to do. Moving forward, you do have less to consider in terms of minimizing your bias, but we recommend that you take further implicit bias tests in other categories to test other biases you may have pertaining to gender, age, religion and disabilities. Using your minimal race bias, you can help to create an inclusive workplace by talking to your coworkers, helping them to evaluate and minimize their own biases, and to continue to keep your biases minor. \n\n__Slight Preference__\n\nHaving a slight bias is completely normal, however, it does not mean you do not need to act on it. A slight bias, in fact, can be just as bad as having a strong bias or worse if it goes unacknowledged. Moving forward, you should consider this bias and think about why you have this bias, and what life experiences or interactions you have had that have given you this type of automatic preference. Then, you should decide how to act against this slight preference so that it does not affect your personal or professional decision and success. Automatically having a preconceived preference for some coworkers over others can be very harmful in meetings and projects, and can negatively impact people who you have power over. You almost certainly would never intentionally discriminate or disrespect your coworkers, so it is important to become aware of how you may do this without realizing it and to correct it before it happens. For example, in a meeting, the boss always selects the same 2 or 3 people of their same race to share their ideas first, and never lets people of another race share their thoughts first. This type of behavior may seem harmless and unintentional, but over time, tensions will build and it will cause the people who are of a different race than the boss to feel isolated and unimportant. In this case, you are losing some very valuable assets of your team that could be contributing to the overall success of the meeting and the company, but a simple bias is allowing that to be overlooked. \n\n__Strong Preference__\n\nHaving a strong bias is not intrinically negative, as long as you acknowledge and work to minimize it! In fact, this can provide more opportunities for growth and learning. Moving forward, you must be fully aware of the bias you have, and try to pinpoint how that might interfere with your daily life. Then, you have to work on reversing your bias, and acting as an ally to the race that you have a lesser preference for. You should engage in team projects and personal discussion with the race that you do not prefer to listen to different perspectives and to become more comfortable with those around you. If you do not work in a very diverse workplace, or do not have the opportunity to work in diverse groups, consider joining a reading club or other discussion group with a more diverse following. The best way to minimize bias is to find the root of it, and work outward to decrease it. For example, if you grew up in a predominantly white area, you are more likely to be biased against people of color because of a lack of exposure to people who are different from yourself. That means that it is important to expose yourself to more diversity now to open your mind and understanding. Being around people who have different backgrounds than you can be extremely beneficial to widening your perspective, improving your empathy, and increasing the productivity of your teams.\n\n## Why You Should be an Ally and Not a Knight (What's the Difference?)\nBeing a perfect ally is something that will never be achieved, yet it is important to keep striving to get better and closer to that. Below are several different roles that allies can and should take on that will be beneficial in and out of the workplace. Allyship is more than just a straightforward formula to follow, it’s about being flexible according to the circumstances and learning when it is an appropriate time to intervene. \n\n![Types of Allies](//images.ctfassets.net/keiomil1rdyy/790uGFpZUvSxsvlFH8UeTa/627e051b99acd56f43424fa39bbc860a/Types_of_Allies.png)\n\nAlthough allies are traditionally thought to be people of power and privilege acting towards people who lack that same power and privilege, the roles are not always that clear cut. Over the next 20 years, the demographics of the workplace will undergo drastic changes, and we will not have the same structure of people in the minority and majority as we do now. Therefore, it is essential for all people- regardless of race, class, gender, age, education, ability, sexuality or gender identity, to act as allies for anyone else in their work or personal environment. There is no reason why women cannot be allies to men, or why a 25 year old cannot be an ally to a 60 year old. Roles in the workplace will change, but being an ally and developing inclusive environments will always reign important for success.\n\n## What Can Challenge Allyship?\nAllyship can be challenged by unchecked or ignored biases, privilege, power, seeking a reward, and a lack of true dedication to change. When being an ally, there are certain things that you should avoid. In *Me & White Supremacy* by Karen Catlin, Optical Allyship and Ally Cookies are defined as some of the pitfalls of trying to be an ally in the workplace. Optical Allyship is “the visual illustration of allyship without the actual work of allyship”, which simply means that you are working harder to make yourself look like a strong ally than actually being a strong ally. You can avoid this by asking your coworkers for their input and striving to continuously improve yourself as an ally. Ally cookies are “praise or other rewards for ‘not being racist’ that is usually sought out by people with white privilege performing optical allyship”. In this case, people who are searching for ally cookies are looking to be recognized as an outstanding individual for acting or appearing as an ally. Allyship is about doing the right thing for the success of the company and its atmosphere, not about receiving rewards or praise for playing a role in an inclusive workplace environment. True allies will not expect anything in return for their allyship and will be constantly working to improve by engaging in meaningful conversations with those around them.\n\n## Additional Tips on Being a Better Ally\nAs we have mentioned, being an ally is a continuos journey. It is important to be open-minded and willing to accept mistakes along the way. We created a list of additional tips to keep in mind as you continue learning:\n- Ask meaningful questions to develop learning\n- Acknowledge your fears\n- Be open and respectful\n- Don’t get defensive\n- Apologize when you make a mistake\n- Acknowledge your biases\n- Know your counter narratives\n- Focus on action and improvement\n\n## Reflection\nWe find that by taking the time to reflect and process information, we come to a better and more wholistic understanding of a concept. Complete a reflection based on your learnings. How do you plan to implement allyship into your own life or professional workplace as the work environment changes in the next 20 years?\n\n## Glossary\n__Allies__- take action to empower individuals, not to rescue them or put themselves in the spotlight; allies also seek to create systemic change, not one-off savior moves\n\n__Ally Cookies__- praise of other rewards for \"not being racist.\" Usually sought out by people with white privilege performing optical allyship\n\n__Intersectionallity__- term coined Dr. Kimberle Crenshaw; framework that helps us to explore the dynamic between coexisting identies and connected systems of oppression particulary as it relates to gender and race\n\n__Optical Allyship__- the visual illustration of allyship without the actual work o allyship (performative allyship or ally theatre)\n\n__Privilege__- a set of unearned benefits given to people who fit into a special social groups due to our race, class, gender, sexual orientation, language, etc.\n\n__Tokenism__- the practice of making only a perfunctory or symbolic effort to do a particular thing, especially by recruiting a small number of people from underrepresented groups in order to give the appearance of sexual or racial equality in the workforce\n\n__Tone Policing__- tactic used by those who have white privilege to silence those who do not by focusing on the tone of what is being said rather than the actual content. TOne policing does not only have to be spoken out loud publicly, people with white privilege often tone police BIPOC in their thoughts or behind closed-doors\n\n__White Apathy__- a feeling of apathy, indifference, unconcern, detachment, dispassion, and disregard about racism by people with white privilege\n\n__White exceptionalism__- the belief that people with white privilege are exempt from white supremacy; belief of being “one of the good ones”\n\n__White Fragility__- state in which even a minimum amount of racial stress becomes intolerable, triggering a range of defensive moves\n\n__White Privilege__- term coined by Peggy McIntosh; “an invisible package of unearned assets that I can count on cashing in each day, but about which I was “meant” to remain oblivious,  white privilege is like an invisible weightless knapsack of special provisions, assurances, tools, maps, guides, etc.\"\n\n__White Silence__- occurs when people with white privilege stay complicity silent when it comes to issues of race\n\n<a name=\"references\"/></a>\n## References\n- [1] Catlin, K.

          "en-US": "The amount of technology in this world has been doubling every 12 months for the past 50 years, and we are on an exponential curve of growth. \n> Futurists predict that 2040 is the year when human intelligence will be overtaken by computer intelligence, which brings forth a tremendous amount of things to consider.\n\nBen Ross describes what the future may look like if humans have to contend against powerful computers. He mentions that we are still 20 years away from the point of human-level artificial intelligence (AI), so we still have the ability to “guide its pathway forward to ensure it’s a great outcome instead of bad.” One way we can do this is by creating guidelines and having them in place as we’re on the cusp of an AI revolution. Ben Ross discusses more of his ideas and thoughts in the video below:\n\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\">\n  <iframe \n    class=\"embed-responsive-item\"\n    src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-KaGZhB0WkI\">\n  </iframe>\n</div>\n\nSuperintelligence is the point at which computers are smarter than humans and can perform better than us. The two main factors that cause this are advances in hardware and software. Collective intelligence can be used in order to string together computers into the overall computer network, which will eventually lead to superintelligence. This is going to happen faster than we expect because technology is doubling every 12 months. \n\nSuperintelligence poses an existential threat, which would be the first of its kind for humans to face. As Steven Hawking stated, superintelligence is “the last invention we’ll ever make and the last challenge we’ll ever face.” This is why creating guidelines moving forward is so important. We as humans possess the ability to adapt to change and be resilient when challenges come our way. We work well together with others and are able to think critically with each other. The rapidly growing amount of artificial intelligence in our lives will take away this ability to collaborate with others out of our lives. Computers are not going to be open to change, they are not resilient. They do not possess any leadership qualities or skills. The bottom line is that people embrace change better than computers do. \n\n![soft-skills-for-essential-skills-blog-image-sm](//images.ctfassets.net/keiomil1rdyy/aJyMGOOjzYXO1ajyfgZEO/eac0ae284507d38ed8b076bf0ae0ff56/soft-skills-for-essential-skills-blog-image-sm.png)\n\n## How to Prepare for the Human Level of Artificial Intelligence\nTo best prepare for this increasing amount of human level artificial intelligence is to create guidelines that start to develop a pathway forward to make sure that we reach a great outcome instead of a bad outcome. These guidelines include three laws of robotics developed by Isaac Asimov back in the 1940s. The first law is that a robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. There have been many instances in our past that have demonstrated the importance of having guidelines. Guidelines with the new DNA technology in the 70s allowed no genetic mutations or other negative consequences to occur. Guidelines are a good place to start when we are entering any new level of technology in our lives. Each and everyone one of us is creating and curating the fact base for superintelligence. We need to start to manage this, we can make sure that artificial intelligence does not become unmanageable.  \n\n## Why Artificial Intelligence Isn’t Enough \nArtificial intelligence is an extraordinary invention that will truly reshape our futures. However, there are many things that artificial intelligence is unable to do, which is why humans are still extremely important. While computers can be programmed to do amazing things extremely fast, they cannot think on their own. Computers cannot be creative without following rules, because they can't break new ground and be innovative.  This essentially means they are not original because they cannot have a vision or purpose without being designed by a human to do so. AI can essentially provide facts or statistics, but there cannot be judgement based off of them. AI does not understand cause and effect, because that would require introspection at the core of cognition. \n\nAs we can see today, diversity and cultural intelligence are important because workplaces are becoming increasingly more open and diverse, and this will only continue on this positive slope of importance. The last two important points as to why humans will be evermore important in the future of AI are because of our ability to embrace change and have a growth mindset. This will allow humans to build upon other skills in order to reach a higher achievement. We should be able to try new things, tackle new challenges, learn from our mistakes, and continually try to learn new things. \n\nHumans should not be afraid of artificial intelligence, because humans are amazing and are much more complex than any form of AI. Instead of fearing AI, we should develop our soft skills and harness our unique human capabilities that computers will never be able to accomplish. \n\n## Takeaways\n- Guidelines should be in place as we start developing the path for artificial intelligence, to ensure a positive outcome. \n- Humans need to be conscious about artificial intelligence and it’s abilities, while recognizing there’s things humans need to improve upon because computers are unable to do them. \n- Improving upon soft skills is more important now than ever before. \n\n<a name=\"references\"/></a>\n## References\n- [1] Choi, Charles L. “Superintelligent AI May Be Impossible to Control; That's the Good News.” IEEE Spectrum: Technology, Engineering, and Science News, 18 Jan. 2021,spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/robotics/artificial-intelligence/super-artificialintelligence. \n- [2] Ross, Ben. “AI With Human-Level Intelligence Will Be Walking the Streets by 2040.” Futurism, \tFuturism, 29 Apr. 2017, futurism.com/ai-human-level-intelligence-walking-streets-2040.

          "en-US": "## Why is Preparing Important?\nStubbornness is incredibly prevalent in human nature and it is not limited from being involved in human relations with technology. You see stubbornness in many forms such as your grandparent refusing to purchase a cell phone and holding on dearly to the wired landline that was the most innovative creation of the 80s. This form of stubbornness may seem innocent and harmless when it involves your sweet grandma, but it is incredibly hazardous when the same mentality is held in the business world when individuals and organizations refuse to move with the change and new developments in technology.\n\n## How to Prepare\nAn effective organization is one that keeps up with new technology and seeks to utilize it to give them the sharpest edge possible on the competition. For instance, Amazon utilized innovations in the smartphone industry to take advantage of the increasingly advanced cameras in your hand to provide an augmented reality application that allows you to virtually place furniture and décor in your room to see how it would look before purchasing it. This type of high-tech, user-oriented feature draws customers to Amazon services and away from the typical brick and mortar furniture store where you must take a tape measure and hope your measurements are right while imagining how it will look. This sort of innovation is not limited to big tech companies like Amazon though. Any organization can utilize modern technology to their advantage. The first step is to learn about the technology that is being developed and expecting to be cutting edge in the business world. It might seem boring to just read science blogs and articles about fictional tech that you cannot purchase yet but it is incredibly important. By doing this, it allows you to picture how your organization can utilize it when it is released to get an advantage on others who may not have known or planned for the new technology. Examples of tech to plan for in 2040 include fully autonomous transportation and shipping, extremely intelligent AI, and a very digitally connected society. In this way it is more effective to plan for future tech than seek to overuse outdated technology.\n\n## Jeff Wilcox Speaks on his Perspective\nThe Lockheed Martin Leadership Institute at Miami University recently had Jeff Wilcox, the retired vice president of digital transformation at Lockheed Martin, speak to us about his views on upcoming change. Check out the video below to hear his perspective and advice for preparing for the changes in technology in 2040:\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6qUXQTbvckU?start=7\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## Talk Summary\nIn his talk, Mr. Wilcox takes a more holistic view of preparing for the future. He steps back from a technological and fortune telling perspective and focuses more on how us as individuals are agents of change in the present and that is our biggest advantage when envisioning the future over any timeline. He talks about how the best way to be prepared is to be the ones creating the future and the best way to do this is to envision the future that you want to live in and the endless possibilities that that future will hold. Next, he says to take a step back and see what actions you, an agent of change, can take in the present to make this envisioned future closer to becoming a reality. Mr. Wilcox specifically emphasized on this quote by Khalil Gibran:\n\n> Progress lies not in enhancing what is, but in advancing towards what will be – Khalil Gibran\n\nMr. Wilcox then said that once your change is in action, and you are beginning your part in the bigger story that you are a character in, it is incredibly important to ask questions and be curious. There is no differing level of importance between questions because it is the curiosity and the urge to learn more that will allow you to explore why things have happened in the past and present that will allow you to build off that foundation to have a stronger future. He very wisely stated that it is important to be gardeners and foster growth around you as a leader, rather than being a chess master and trying to manipulate and use others to achieve a “win.” By gardening and growing your future, you will gain better perspective to where things grew from and you can improve as you move forward, living in the present.\n\n## TLDR\n- It is important to prepare for future innovations while they are still a concept and not a reality by doing what you can in the present.\n- It is important to avoid being stubborn when working with technology.\n- You are agents of change in the present and should work towards the future that you want now, rather than focus on what will happen later.\n\n## Further Reading\n[QUANTUMRUN: Predictions for 2040](https://quantumrun.com/future-timeline/2040 \"QuantumRun Forecast\")\n\n## References\nS.

          "en-US": "One of the new and promising technologies that we have heard about is the Neuralink. It is a brain-chip interface that is meant to treat paraplegics, but has potential to resolve a number of mental and physical ailments. There is some controversy around the invasiveness of the device and how it affects the privacy of the user. The main reason for this device is said to help paraplegics but one day it is said to be available to the public as a way of linking your brain to your devices. \n\n![Neuralink Pill](//images.ctfassets.net/keiomil1rdyy/7HxHuk8HojpEdSVW47xYdj/1099b835ca6b8c6945b50f8ca32cc517/1.png)\n\n## What is the Neuralink?\nThe goal of this device is to solve important brain and spine problems with a seamlessly implanted device [[1]](#references). Back in 2019 the original architecture of the device was a link behind your ear. Over the next year they have already made major advancements. Now the device is just a singular disk, about the size of a large coin. In the video you can see what the device looks like. It sits flush with your skull, it has 1024 channels per link, megabit wireless data rate, and an all day battery life. Getting the link implanted would take less than an hour, and can be done without general anesthesia. In the video below, Elon Musk shows a demonstration of the device implanted in pigs. He shows us three pigs, one without the implant, one that used to have the implant but it was taken out, and a third who currently has an implant. All three pigs looked healthy and were functioning as pigs do. For the third pig, we can see that when the pig touches something in her snout it sends a signal to the device which is displayed on the screen along with a little noise. Along with that they showed a pig on a treadmill and they showed how they could predict its movement before it moved with quite an impressive accuracy. \n\nIn the question and answer portion of the video, one of the audience members asked what the practical use for this device would be and Elon replied that if you can predict what someone wants to do with their spine, you could add another implant in the spine which allows them to gain full mobility back. The next question that was asked is, could you store your memories and replay them later. Elon answered, “yes, you could actually store your memories and upload them as a backup and restore the memories”.\n\n![approach-link-2](//images.ctfassets.net/keiomil1rdyy/13jahLeifusOWstCgFNxpV/e237b59ccc4ff3c857f299f8a08f819c/2.png)\n\n## Author's Views\nThere are a lot of different things that could come from this technology and from the video we can already see that there will be a lot of more things to expect in the future. For any one who has seen the show Black Mirror, Elon states in the video that they predicted it very closely. That even beyond controlling your devices, you could replay your memories and even upload them to a robot or another body. We are watching tv shows now that have this kind of technology and to think that in the coming years it could be turned into a reality is an incredible thing to think about. This is why we are talking about it now, so that when the time comes we are all prepared to accept and handle this technology.\n\nLooking at the past few decades, we can see an exponential increase in the technological advancements made available to the general public. Many people can remember back to when they had a car phone, and now we are carrying small screens that are more powerful than the computers that sent us to the moon in our pockets. With Neuralink, it’s reasonable to imagine that brain-chip devices are going to be available within our lifetime. It’s often hard to keep up with how fast things are moving, but we are seeing new technology such as self-driving cars that seem to appear out of thin air. So many powerful technologies are emerging and becoming widely available for integration into our daily lives, so it is important to imagine how your lifestyle may change within the next couple decades.\n\n## Neuralink Presentation \n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\">\n<iframe\nclass=\"embed-responsive-item\"\nsrc=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CLUWDLKAF1M\"/>\n</iframe>\n</div>\n\n## Conclusion\nTechnology is growing at unbelievable rates, implementing itself into our lives faster than ever with more and more daily uses in the world around us. This video of Neuralink makes it obvious that the previous statement is one of fact. We can see that within a year, Neuralink’s brain chip has gotten smaller and massively more impressive. If it takes one year for something of this caliber to improve on an exponential scale, you can imagine how smaller technologies are making their way into our daily lives, transforming society right before our eyes. It won’t take long for this kind of technology to be available to the masses, so it’s important to keep up with the ever changing world we live in.\n\n## Takeaways\n- The Neuralink is a revolutionionary piece of technology that has the potential to change how we live our everyday lives.\n- We need to be aware of the new technology so that we know what we need to adapt to\n- We continue to see more and more life altering technology come out every year, so it's important that we are open to embracing new tech\n\n## Further Reading\n- [Neuralink Official Website](https://neuralink.com/)\n\n<a name=\"references\"/></a>\n## References \n- [1] Home,” Neuralink.

I'm here today with Casey, a member of cohort nine of the Lockheed Martin Leadership Institute. How are you doing today, Casey?\n\n__Casey Jackowski 0:12__\nI'm doing pretty good.\n\n__Jacqueline McCully 0:14__\nAwesome. So, today we are going to be talking about this year's project: Envision 2040. Could you tell me a little bit about why the Envision 2040 project is important?\n\n__Casey Jackowski 0:24__\nYeah, so in order to create a better future, we need to look forward in order to understand what steps we should take together as a human race. If we can visualize what's possible and decide which path is best, we can have a clear aim towards developing that future. A lot can happen in 20 years. But the fact that we are looking specifically at 2040 doesn't matter as much as we are looking for what life could be far into the future. We're focusing on topics: advancing technology, diversity, equity, inclusion, and human interaction because these are the topics that will most likely have the largest impact on our society in 2040. We want to think at a large scale and provide insights and possibilities for these topics, being creative with our insights could possibly spark interest in someone that could possibly make an entirely new reality, or even spark something in ourselves. The world is full of possibilities, and we want to explore them with this project.\n\n__Jacqueline McCully 1:18__\nAwesome. I think that's very true. Um, what are some insights that you have gotten in exploring this topic?\n\n__Casey Jackowski 1:26__\nSo my focus area was on human communication, and how emerging technologies will transform it. Technology is being developed at an astonishing rate and we're all walking around with a tiny computer in our pocket that connects us to people all over the globe and that's extraordinary. Just think about what could be invented in the next 20 years! The technology we create will only increase our connection with others. Communication and collaboration is what makes us human. Through new technologies, we have only encouraged more communication with each other - letters, telegrams, phones, video conferencing, you're using technology to get closer to in-person communication across large distances. I believe AR and VR, the next logical step in this process, you'll be able to speak and see each other's expressions and body language in virtual form and not have to be in the same room together.\n\n__Jacqueline McCully 2:18__\nYeah, I mean, look what we're doing right now.\n\n__Casey Jackowski 2:20__\nYeah!\n\n__Jacqueline McCully 2:21__\nSo what are you going to do to prepare for the future?\n\n__Casey Jackowski 2:25__\nI'm not really going to prepare for the future. Preparing gives the connotation I know what will happen, and I'll be ready for it when it inevitably comes. Instead, I want to be part of creating this future and adapting with the information I find along the way. However, something I could do to prepare is to practice a growth mindset so I can view failure as a learning experience, and develop grit by focusing on innovations I'm passionate about. I'm intrigued about the future and I want to be a positive influence on it.\n\n__Jacqueline McCully 2:52__\nAwesome, thank you so much for talking with me today. I hope you have a great rest of your day too!\n\n__Casey Jackowski 2:57__\nYou too!"

My name is Charlie Clark. I'm in Cohort 10 of Lockheed Martin Leadership Institute. I'm here with Evan Franzman. He's in Cohort 9 of Lockheed Martin Leadership Institute. Why don't you tell us a little about yourself, Evan.\n\n__Evan Franzman 0:18__\nYeah, my name is Evan. I'm a computer science major. I'm a junior this year and I'm in Cohort 10. Our project this year is Envision 2040. And I'm sure we'll get into that a little bit.\n\n__Charlie Clark 0:29__\nYeah. Awesome. So why don't you tell us a little bit about why Envision 2040 is important to you?\n\n__Evan Franzman 0:35__\nYeah, so Envision 2040 is important to me, because it kind of builds on the foundation of the previous two cohorts and their big ideas. So they talked about embracing change, and then digital transformation. And Envision 2040 is kind of the action steps and how to accomplish that, in the future, how to embrace the change that's coming with the imminent digital transformation. So it's important to me because it tells me exactly what I'm going to need to be doing in 20 years, or to prepare myself for the future.\n\n__Charlie Clark 1:00__\nAwesome. And what insights have you gained from working on the 2040 project?\n\n__Evan Franzman 1:06__\nYeah, I've gained a lot of insights, a lot of insights have been kind of shifted towards me as a team member and working in a team. Because, you know, it's not just me doing this, there's 20 of us working on this really hard and kind of coordinating things together in order to make sure that it's a big message. So it makes sure it's cohesive. And it makes sense, has a lot of moving parts. So being able to coordinate with team members is definitely a huge insight I have. In terms of the project, I think the big one is kind of focusing more on people rather than technology. I mean, we've seen in a matter two years, how we shifted from in person working to online like that. And you know, in 20 years, it's going to be, you know, another thing, so focus less on the technology of things and more on how do we prepare people to implement technology and adapt to technology in the future?\n\n__Charlie Clark 1:55__\nAwesome. And that kind of leads me into my next question. What are you going to do to prepare for the future now that you've been working on this project? And with everything that's happened in the last year? That's kind of opened your eyes to the Envision 2040 idea?\n\n__Evan Franzman 2:15__\nYeah, I think without spoiling too much, one of the big things I'm gonna be doing is reading, you know, Google's a great thing. And all the there's so much information out there. I'm sure when we get our website finalized, we're gonna have a ton of resources for people to look into and read on their own and make their own kind of assumptions and decisions about what they want to do in the future. On top of that, just kind of keeping up to date with what everybody else is going on. You know, it's important to understand technology, but it's also important to understand, you know, what's going on culturally to make sure you're up to date there. Don't be too myopic in your thinking, don't think, Oh, I only need to focus on technology, I only need to focus on diversity and inclusion, like really kind of encompass the future for everything that's going to hold and try and not limit yourself to one kind of lens. I think we're going to talk about that a lot on the website and any presentations we do, but that's kind of like a little, you know, trailer for what, what's to come the next few weeks.\n\n__Charlie Clark 3:09__\nAwesome. Well, that's a little bit about how Evan's experience with Envision 2040. And now we're going to hear from some other people at Cohort 9."

Today I'm talking to Rebecca Gruenberg, who is a junior Computer Science major about her work with Cohort IX's Envision 2040 project, Envision 2040 imagines how the world would look in 20 years with a special focus on diversity, inclusion, technology and human interaction with technology. So, Rebecca, why is Envision 2040 so important?\n\n__Rebecca Gruenburg 0:28__\nYeah, well, you know, the world is becoming increasingly more technologically focused, you know, at really an exponential pace. But that means that there's going to be a lot more changes and much shorter amount of time. So our Envision 2040 project is really meant to address how you can navigate, you know, these copious amounts of change, and what the future might look like. So we can better prepare ourselves for it. Um, you know, we can't, you know, see the future, we can't tell the future. But we can look at current trends and progressions in order to best understand the direction that we're going, as individuals and as a society in this digital age.\n\n__Elise Belanger 1:03__\nGreat. So what insights have you gotten from exploring this topic?\n\n__Rebecca Gruenburg 1:09__\nYeah, well, I worked on the embracing inclusion lens of our project, which is really just about discovering those demographic changes and trends going towards 2040. Especially, you know, when the United States specifically becomes a much more diverse nation, which means we really need to be creating more engaging and inclusive workplaces. But more specifically, I worked on an article about algorithmic bias, and how it really promotes a lot of prejudice. And stereotypes, I was really surprised about how pervasive that can be, especially within, you know, different search engines, considering that searches are optimized for the user. And that can really be an issue when it comes to those, you know, targeting results, which start to display a lot of bias and discrimination. So really being mindful about, you know, searches in the expected audience. And then those their biases is really important. And it's really an insight that has to be kept in mind as tech gets more and more advanced. And as the world gets more and more diverse.\n\n__Elise Belanger 2:06__\nGreat. So what are you doing personally, to prepare for the future?\n\n__Rebecca Gruenburg 2:12__\nYeah, the key thing that I'm really doing to prepare for the future is working on recognizing you know, key patterns and trends. And then working on mastering or at least trying to stay up to date on you know, all these new forms of technology that can that started, you know, coming out or just becoming more mainstream. The book \"Thinking in the Future Tense\", by Jennifer James has some really great insights on how to prepare your mind and change your habits, specifically as an individual to get the most out of the present. So I definitely would recommend that book. But ultimately, just really learning to recognize trends in technology, and diversity and the way we interact with one another will really be key and understanding, you know, short term and long term changes. Staying up to date on technology, then, of course, helps me one as a computer science major, you know, understand relevant stuff in my own field and industry, but then also better understand what the future of work and our personal lives look like going forward.\n\n__Elise Belanger 3:12__\nThat's great. I think I'm gonna check out that book. So thank you for speaking with us today.\n\n__Rebecca Gruenburg 3:13__\nYeah, of course. Thank you."

I am Zainab Soumahoro. I'm part of Lockheed Insitution cohort 10. This is Rachel Duke. She's part of cohort nine. I'm just going to ask a few questions about Envision 2040, the project that her and cohort is working on. And also how are you, Rachel?\n\n__Rachel Duke 0:27__\nI'm good. How are you?\n\n__Zainab Soumahoro 0:29__\nI'm good as well. That's great to hear. So the first question I'm going to ask you is why is the Envision 2040 project important?\n\n__Rachel Duke 0:37__\nI think that the Envision 2040 project is super important because it's something that we're all going to live. It's something that people who are already in industry are going to live, we're going to, we're going to see how this world changes over the next 20 years. And it's really, really important for us to prepare for that, to know how to be flexible, and how to adapt to the changes that are going to happen in the next 20 years because we're all going to be a part of it and we're all going to experience it in the workplace.\n\n__Zainab Soumahoro 1:01__\nVery nice answer! Very good answer! Okay, so the next question I'm going to ask you is, what insights have you gotten in exploring this topic?\n\n__Rachel Duke 1:13__\nIn exploring this topic, I've gained some insights, I've done a lot of research on allyship and how to be a really good ally, and how everyone can be an ally, you don't have to be a person of power or privilege in order to be an ally, you can be an ally to anyone in any situation. And also just the idea that so much is going to change in the next 20 years that like we can't even really comprehend it. Some of the changes are going to be so drastic that we would never think that they're possible today. But they will be like, if we look back 20 years ago, we probably didn't think some of the things possible today are but then they happened. So yeah, keep an open mind. And to think of that, those are some of the biggest insights I've had.\n\n__Zainab Soumahoro 1:50__\nWow! Those are nice insights, very eye-opening. So the last question I'm going to ask you is, what are you going to do to prepare for the future?\n\n__Rachel Duke 2:03__\nIn order to prepare for the future, I think I'm going to personally keep a really open mind, work to do a lot of like embracing different changes. Making sure that you're flexible and adapting as time goes on and not, you know, staying stuck in one mindset, it's important to like, grow in our mindset, and to continue to learn and to continue to better yourself throughout the changes, especially because the changes in the next 20 years, they're going to be so much bigger than in the last 20 years. And it's just going to be a totally different world. So it's important to be flexible and adaptable.\n\n__Zainab Soumahoro 2:36__\nOkay, thank you so much, Rachel. That was very nice answers. I hope your guys' project goes well, and everything turns out you know, even though obviously right now a bit hectic, struggle is like, you know, a hassle and stuff like that. So I hope everything comes out well! Thank you so much for taking this time out of your day to answer some of my questions.\n\n__Rachel Duke 2:29__\nYeah, absolutely. Thank you."

And I'm here with my mentor Ethan Cunningham, who's a junior bioengineering major here at Miami. And today he's going to talk to us about his cohort's impressive Envision 2040 project and how it's helping him prepare for the future. So Ethan, To start off, can you tell me why this project is important?\n\n__Ethan Cunningham 0:29__\nThanks, Asia, this project, super important, because if we're not future minded, if we have no goals, if we don't know where we're headed, then we have like, no structure of what we're doing now. And I think when we came up with this project, obviously, we're mid like, in the middle of pandemic, and so nobody could have seen this coming. And so we're thinking, Okay, what are the things that nobody can see coming in 2040, the next 20 years. And that's, that's basically what our goal is to try to predict the unpredictable, and see what we look like in 2040.\n\n__Asia Flores 1:03__\nYeah, I totally agree. That's so interesting. So I mean, you guys have been working on this for going on a year now. So during that time, what are some of the greatest insights you gained? about this project?\n\n__Ethan Cunningham 1:15__\nYeah, that's a great question. Me personally, I am looking at some of the like, demographics and stuff like how, like, what, what are people going to, what's the people population going to look like, in the US come 2040. Um, my biggest personally, my biggest insight is one, the white population percentage is going to go down. So we're going be looking at approaching I think 2050 is when we crossed the actual mark of like, white non Hispanic population to hit like 49.6%. And in the US, which is just sounds like a number right now. But when you think about it, moving into 20 years, we talk a lot about diversity today. But once we reach like, 2040, we see a lot more BIPOC, people in, you know, in offices, and important positions. And so like, we talked about reaching critical masses, and like, comfortability, and stuff like that, and like making decisions and respecting decisions, which I think is huge. And like, now we're kind of looking at, if you look around people my age, there's, you know, more women in school than men. You think about like, especially me when I go to class, like if, if the women in class are doing most of the team projects, which is sometimes the norm, like, come 20 years, they're going be doing all the work in the executive office, right. And so, which I think is really cool. Another, like standout point is, you know, people my age, I'll be 40 years old, and 2040. And so we'll be in kind of places of power or importance influence, stuff like that. And when you look at it, like, like me, personally, when I think of diversity and stuff, it doesn't seem that weird to me, personally, like the idea of like, other people of color, like having power. And like, a good example is like, for eight years of my life, Barack Obama was the president. And now for like, at least the next four years, Kamala Harris is going to be on the vice president. And so if you think about that, by the time I turn 24, and 2024, there'll be a person of color and either the presidency or the vice presidency office, which is kind of like, it doesn't seem like a lot, but I think that's kind of like huge, like, a cultural norm that might define our generation.\n\n__Asia Flores 3:41__\nYeah, those are all really, really interesting points. So, you know, taking all of that into account, how has this project helped you prepare for the future?\n\n__Ethan Cunningham 3:52__\nThat's a great question. So me personally, I, as a, as a white male, looking at toxic diversity can kind of be seen sometimes when I read books and stuff, it's like, oh, like the white man is kind of the, the evil person in it. And it's not so much of the evil person there's, you know, but like the the institute itself, like white supremacy, white power, white norm normativity, stuff like that. And so looking at it, how can I just like be an ally and how can I look to intentionally be more inclusive? Um read a great book called \"Whistling Vivaldi\", by Dr. Claude Steele, who his main research phenomenal research is on stereotype threat. And I know kind of like since we're little we've we've talked about stereotyping and how stereotyping is bad, which it is I totally agree. But the his research is on the effects of stereotype, stereotype threat. And this is where I think we can insert a lot of intentionality into like, if we understand that people under stereotype threat, they perceive these cues of like, Oh, I'm not really wanted here and you know, people on like my side the white male side of the equation are like, like, that's not true, like, you know, try to like rationalize, like, okay, so there's no like, people of color like in office like that doesn't mean you'd not wanted here. But people are picking up on cues. And in any small queue, like, the smaller, the more and the smaller the queue, the more intentional you can and have to be to remove that that threat and people will notice that like, way more than you think. And I think as like our generation grows up. There's surveys and stuff that like people, people want to be hired by companies who foster include inclusivity, diversity and who actually care about their people.\n\n__Asia Flores 5:43__\nYeah, absolutely. And I think that discussion is becoming more and more part of the equation as we become more educated as individuals. And I think this stuff is really important to talk about, and I think it's great that you've been doing all this research about it and are going to be able to share that with people and I'm excited to hear more about it. So thank you so much for being here, Ethan and I can't wait to hear more.\n\n__Ethan Cunningham 6:05__\nThank you for having me. Excited for you to see what we have."

Today I'm here with Kirsten Benedict, a junior mechanical engineering major from cohort 9 to discuss Envision 2040, which is a collaborative project that predicts how the future will look in the next 20 years. Welcome Kirsten!\n\n__Kirsten Benedict 0:25__<br>\nThank you.\n\n__Brian Dlugos 0:26__<br>\nTo start off our discussion, tell me about the Envision 2040 project and what your focus area is and why it's important to you.\n\n__Kirsten Benedict 0:35__<br>\nSo the Envision 2040 project is a project that is looking into what our life in the future is going to be like. So us as future leaders, are trying to see how to best prepare ourselves for our daily norm. And especially like through the COVID pandemic, we've seen, like how the amount of technology in our lives has increased dramatically. And that's what my focus focus topic is. And this is important to me, because being an engineering major, and seeing how much technology is being used in our field, and also see how much technology is being used for us to learn now is increasing. And it's just important for me and for everybody else to see how, like we need to move with technology into the future to make sure that doesn't overcome our lives.\n\n__Brian Dlugos 1:20__<br>\nYeah, that's really interesting. What insights have you gotten in exploring this topic?\n\n__Kirsten Benedict 1:26__<br>\nSo more specifically, my topic has to do with artificial intelligence and how, by the year 2040, they're expecting that artificial intelligence is going to exceed human intelligence. And they're saying that they're sorry, technology is growing exponentially, and that we're on an exponential curve of growth. So they're saying that, by the time 2040 rolls around that the technology is going to be performing jobs that are being currently performed by humans. And it's important for us as leaders to guide this growth of technology because we, as leaders, we humans are able to be resilient and adapt to change. And that's something that computers cannot do. So like I said, like we make sure that we're being mindful of what we're doing on the internet, because if we're not, we could see ourselves being controlled by technology in the future.\n\n__Brian Dlugos 2:23__<br>\nYeah. With everything you've learned from working on this project, what are you personally going to prepare for for the future?\n\n__Kirsten Benedict 2:32__<br>\nI've learned so much through this project, especially seeing how much technology it's going to increase in our lives in the next 20 years. But I think like being a leader, myself, I'm going to educate not only myself but others of being mindful of what they're doing on the internet, because the computers are time stamping and mapping us. Every time we do something on the internet, every time we Google Search something, they're like, keeping track of what we've been doing. And I think we should just limit that because that's feeding into the issue of technology overtaking our lives.\n\n__Brian Dlugos 3:06__<br>\nGot it! Well, thank you for sharing your ideas and plans with us, Kiersten, and I'm excited to see what you guys have planned.\n\n__Kirsten Benedict 3:12__<br>\nAll right. Thank you."

The first question I have for you Kabir is why is Envision 2040 your project important?\n\n__Kabir Arora  0:20__  \nHi, Hannah thank you for the introduction. So I would say our project is very important because as Cohort 8 and Cohort 7, before us have had their big topics of Embracing Change and Digital Transformation. Our topic focuses more on the future and what it's going to hold for us. So our topic it combines both of those of the last two cohorts. And we focus it on three different lenses. So we have the future of technology, we have diversity and inclusion, and we have human interaction. And in each one of those different subcategories, we go on to talk about what each one has, what to expect for each one and what the future may look like for it.\n\n__Hannah Duncan  1:02__  \nThat's awesome. Thank you, what insights would you say that kind of learning and working on this project has taught you?\n\n__Kabir Arora  1:08__  \nSo as a cohort altogether, we have a whole list of possible insights. That we're going to be telling everyone about a few that me and my teammates are working on are, what new technologies can we expect to become a new norm. And one of those is I'll give you a little sneak peek. It's called the neural link, which is a technology that they're coming out with, which is a brain implant that goes on the back of your head, which allows your brain to directly communicate with all your other devices.\n\n__Hannah Duncan  1:37__  \nWow, that's really interesting. Right? So that's, that's pretty exciting little sneak peek for everything, we're gonna have to look forward to coming out with the publication of your, your project. So what would you say, Envision 2040 has taught you personally and kind of preparing for your future, and what you'll do with the rest of your career?\n\n__Kabir Arora  1:56__  \nYeah, so a lot of the research that we've done, I've been honestly, shocked by, because before, before starting any of this and like before realizing what 2040 is gonna hold for us. I wasn't expecting anything major to change. But we took a look at what changed the past 20 years. And we looked at how that could affect us in the future 20 years, right. So personally, I've, I'm super excited to see all the new technologies coming out. And all the new ways that we can use technologies to advance like, our like human interaction with each other, and like our communication with each other, and as well as the different like diversities coming to America. And as we can see already today, we have a whole like mixing pot and like I would just it's so exciting to see how that's going to grow on in the future.\n\n__Hannah Duncan  2:43__  \nThat's awesome. Thank you for sharing that. It's very exciting to kind of hear how societies going to be able to interact with expanding technologies and how we can come together as a community and kind of learn from that. Well, I thank you for your time today. It's been great to talk to you and I really look forward to Envision 2040 and everything coming out with that."

And I will have the wonderful opportunity to interview Julia Kocher from Cohort 9, about their Envision 2040 project.\n\n__Julia Kocher 0:18__\nHi, Morgan, thank you for having me.\n\n__Morghan Jones 0:16__\nHi, Julia. It's a wonderful opportunity to talk to you today about your project. So we have a few questions for you today. And the first question is, why is Envision 2040 an important project,\n\n__Julia Kocher 0:35__\nI think it's important because it really gives us an insight into what life will look like in 2040, and then how we prepare for that life in the future. And we did this through three main lenses, which were advancement in technology, inclusion, and then human interaction. And doing this project really allowed me to see how overlapping and interconnected all of those three were, which really shows how important each of them is for the future. I really liked this project, because we were able to incorporate the two projects of the last two cohorts into this one, which were embracing change and digital transformation. And we really looked at how we can do those things in the future of 2040. Going a little bit more in depth about each of the three lenses, it's clear that advancements technology will be prevalent in the future, because it is on an exponential curve. And we can clearly see that today. And we tried to look at how technological capabilities will change and affect our daily lives in the future and how we can react to that. And then the second one was inclusion, which I think is a word that most people are familiar with today, because it is becoming more important. And also, we'll just continue to do that in the future. So we tried to look at how diverse 2040 will be, which will include people from all over the world that we're interacting with, and people just with many different backgrounds. And we really just tried to focus on what to do now until 2040. And then from 2040 on in order to establish a more inclusive workplace, and then hopefully, that would translate to just the world in general. And then the last topic we talked about was human interaction, because human interaction may be different and a little bit affected because of technology. So we tried to explore how humans will communicate and how those face-to-face interactions and how those relationships might be changed with technology.\n\n__Morghan Jones 2:25__\nThank you, Julia, for the response. I really liked how you talked about human interactions, and I appreciate it. My next question for you today is what is the insight that you have gotten in exploring this topic.\n\n__Julia Kocher 2:40__\nSo part of the project that I mainly worked on was kind of exploring the relationship between humans and artificial intelligence, we've tried to look at how to prepare for the human level of artificial intelligence and kind of what superintelligence means. And I think probably the most important thing I learned was that artificial intelligence is not enough to overtake humans, because there are so many things that computers can't do that humans can. So like they can't think on their own or be programmed to do so. They can't be creative, and other things like that, which makes soft skills and the things that make humans even more important for the future. And then some of the soft skills that I talked about in the module of our project, were creativity, critical thinking, emotional intelligence, leadership, cultural intelligence, and then having a growth mindset, which is really important for adaptation into the future. And then I feel like just overall, it really showed me that humans should not be afraid of artificial intelligence. And instead, we should just focus on harnessing our unique abilities that make us us and just that will allow us to be best prepared and most successful in 2040.\n\n__Morghan Jones 3:55__\nThank you for that response, as well. Um, as a computer scientist, I don't like artificial technology. So I love how you said that we should harness and embrace that. And thank you. Our next question is, where are you going to do to prepare for the future?\n\n__Julia Kocher 4:16__\nYeah, so in general, I feel like a lot of these topics just come back around to being human and just doing things that robots or technology cannot do. And I was really able to see how all three topics of the lenses kind of interact, interact with each other and overlap. As you can even tell from the part that I worked on. It kind of was under one sub section, but really, engulf, all three of them. But I would say overall, I'm going to try to work on my soft skills the most in the future, because I feel like they're going to be most important in 2040 because computers will be able to do a lot of the other things and more technical skills that we are kind of usually focusing on more in today's society. So I guess I'm just trying to focus on relationships with others my communication skills and just really again, I know I'm being repetitive but this is important, just doing the things that computers can't do, because that's what make us special and unique.\n\n__Morghan Jones 5:11__\nYes, that's what makes humans, humans. Well, thank you so much. You answer all the questions perfectly, gave us good response about your project and I'm so excited to see what you and Cohort 9 would be like your finishing project! And thank you again for speaking with me.\n\n__Julia Kocher 5:30__\nThank you so much for having me. Have a good day. You too.\n"

And what I kind of mean by that is the fact of, like, when we look at, like the COVID-19 pandemic, I think there was a lot of like, almost retroactive introspection of, especially between like organizations and individuals, to where people were seeing all of these things that they needed to change about themselves as individuals, as well as companies needing to change in order to accommodate like the pandemic. And I think Envision 2040 is important, because rather than being like, okay, here's what you can do now, it also asks the question of, here's what you can be doing over the next 20 years to proactively make yourself as an individual more prepared for the future? By kind of looking into here's potential ways that are like, here's, here's almost ways that the future could potentially go and here is ways that maybe you as an individual should consider changing or just, you know, even thinking about to accommodate that. So I think that's for at least for me, I think that's the big reason why Envision 2040 as a project is important.\n\n__Karissa Waterworth 1:36__\nOkay. So like, what have you learned in the process of working on a project of this scale and importance?\n\n__Kyle Lierer 1:42__\nThere is a lot of intersectionalities, between various topics. I think, to a certain degree, that's already pretty obvious, especially given our topics of, you know, we're looking into the future of technology, we're looking into diversity and inclusion. And we're also just kind of looking into, like, general human interaction. So I think to a certain degree, it's like, yeah, that makes sense that there is intersectionality between them. But like, once you start diving into the nitty-gritty, I think it becomes more apparent of all of these topics really, really play into each other. So for instance, I did a lot of research into looking into, like algorithmic bias. And that kind of plays into all three of the topics because it almost asked the question of how are algorithms and mathematical models affecting people's daily lives. And that's, that is a very, very, like, broad subject. But there's a lot of intersectionalities there, and there was more intersectionality there than I ever really anticipated before looking into it.\n\n__Karissa Waterworth 2:52__\nSo I guess, like, more specifically, like, what have you been working on throughout this project?\n\n__Kyle Lierer 2:52__\nSo at least like me, personally, I've primarily been working on a, what we're calling a module that looks into, like, the relationship between mathematical models and like, systematic oppression. So for instance, if you look at a search engine, like Google, for instance, and you type in key terms. So for instance, if you looked up the key term professor or something like that. Google might give you back results that are majority, like mostly men, and that is an example of mathematical bias at action. And that can have real consequences, because that is creating stereotypes that are being perpetuated in the real world. And as algorithms, mathematical models become more and more prevalent in day-to-day life, I think it's important to it's important to take into account how they are having consequences on the real world. And as we move into the next 20 years, the importance of taking that into consideration will only get more and more important. And we need to be proactive about thinking about that. Because otherwise there might be consequences that we can't handle retroactively. And we need to handle those proactively both as individuals and as almost like a society in general. So that's kind of that's kind of where my like area of research has been focused in.\n\n__Karissa Waterworth 2:57__\nYeah, it's very interesting, that idea of like looking forward and seeing opportunities and problems before they occur, and that's very important. What are you going to do to prepare for the future?\n\n__Kyle Lierer 2:58__\nUm, I think very broadly, I'm going to be more forward-thinking in general. So for instance, as a computer science major, and I As someone who works on a lot of projects, in the past, I haven't really typically thought about the consequences those projects and stuff might have on others, it's typically more like okay, here's a problem, I'm gonna solve it and then I'm not really gonna think about it past that. But I think moving into the future, I'm definitely going to be a little bit more proactive and thinking about okay, what are the consequences of my actions as an individual going to have moving into the future. So I intend to be more like forward-thinking in that respect of thinking more about the consequences of my actions and how that will affect not only myself but others.\n\n__Karissa Waterworth 3:01__\nInteresting!"

How are you\ndoing today, Kyle?\n\n__Kyle Lochtefeld 0:11__\nI'm doing quite well. How about yourself?\n\n__Sam Kuhbander 0:14__\nI'm doing good. Um, and could you start off\nin telling us why your project Envision 2040 is important?\n\n__Kyle Lochtefeld 0:23__\nI think project is important, just because we're trying to figure out what the future is gonna hold, you know, I mean, so that means we figuring out the skills that we think are going to be required to be successful in 2040. I mean, with those skills, then you can plan ahead, you can start working on something that you think is gonna be relevant later. So you're prepared for it later, instead of have to figure it out whenever else figuring it out, you can be one step ahead. You know, and not only that, it's just have an idea kind of what the place I mean, what it's gonna look like, what's gonna be out there. I mean, it's just kind of interesting. For one. And for two, it's just to be prepared and maybe start working on some of those things, or just having those thoughts in mind when you're creating stuff or just planning it.\n\n__Sam Kuhbander 1:06__\nWhat insights have you gotten from exploring\nthis topic?\n\n__Kyle Lochtefeld 1:10__\nSo I'm actually currently writing an article on the future technology of vehicles. So the three main power sources I've noticed that are currently being researched, and trying to be developed and used is hydrogen, biofuel, and electric. So currently, electric is taking a strong lead compared to those other two technologies, but you never know, with how, what the future holds. And I mean, one technology,only one thing that advanced, we find out something new about hydrogen or biofuel, electric and other one might fall off the face of the earth, and it's gonna become the new thing. So it's always interesting. But currently, I think, at least from my research, I think electric has the lead on the other two, though.\n\n__Sam Kuhbander 1:51__\nRight! And then lastly, what are you going\nto do to prepare for the future?\n\n__Kyle Lochtefeld 1:55__\nOkay, so I'm an engineering major, just like the fellow members in my cohort, and we learned a lot of technological skills as an engineering major, you know. So going into 2040, though, I think having interpersonal skills are just gonna be just as important as our technical skills. And maybe even more important than that are technical skills, I don't know. But we'll also be working with a diverse group of people probably. And so that's not only people that are from a different background, but that also can be people from different fields of studies. But I think that overall, the most important thing is to make sure you just have continued learning because things are gonna be changing. I mean, technology is improving faster and faster. So it's just having that continued learning. So you can keep up with it. I mean, you keep learning the newest, newest, newest thing, you can't just get out of college and say, okay, I'm going to work for my 45th years or whatever it is that point and then retire because you're gonna have to learn the new thing because otherwise, you're going to get left behind. I think that's the largest thing to grab onto out of all that though, is to keep learning.\n\n__Sam Kuhbander 2:59__\nAlright, well, thank you for your time today\nand I look forward to learning more about your project as you put more and more out. Thanks for talking to me!\n\n__Kyle Lochtefeld 3:08__\nYeah, thanks for having me. Have a good one.\n\nTranscribed by https://otter.ai"

He is a junior Computer Engineering major in Cohort Nine and he is from Circleville. He is going to be talking to us a little bit about the Envision 2040 project. So could you briefly explain the project to us?\n\n__Noah Macdonald 0:18__\nYeah, so previous Institute topics that other cohorts have done had been embracing change and digital transformation. So, we already have a good foundation to build on our topic on which is envisioning 2040. Envisioning 2040 addresses how we're going to embrace change in the coming digital transformation. So as technology evolves and continues with time, we're going to look into how it's going to change and what we can do to be ready for it.\n\n__Megan Fanok 0:53__\nAwesome. So my first question for you, Noah, is why is the Envision 2040 project so important?\n\n__Noah Macdonald 1:00__\nWell, I believe this project is especially important to us as university students, because 2040 is about 19 years from now, we're going to be in the middle of our careers - it helps to know what's coming.\n\n__Megan Fanok 1:16__\nDefinitely! So can you give us some insights on what you have gotten in exploring this topic?\n\n__Noah Macdonald 1:20__\nMy team has done a lot of work with the future of transportation. And I think it's really cool to look into how everyone's predicting a new push for clean energy and AI-driven vehicles and a bunch of other really sci-fi-sounding things. It's just fascinating to see! A few actual insights I'd say would be: change is coming... it helps to know what it is. And the future is actually not hard to look into. It's being correct that's the challenge. We're aiming to be as correct as possible with our upcoming project.\n\n__Megan Fanok 1:59__\nAwesome. Yeah, it's definitely something that's a little more obscure to be correct about, but you can definitely make a lot of predictions.\n\n__Noah Macdonald 2:06__\nAbsolutely.\n\n__Megan Fanok 2:07__\nSo what are you going to do to prepare for the future?\n\n__Noah Macdonald 2:09__\nI'm personally trying to have more foresight. I'm trying to look a little further into the future, but not all the way. I'm going to try and do that more as I go on. So that I'm more prepared in case something comes up - like an emergency happens. I'm hopefully going to be a little more prepared.\n\n__Megan Fanok 2:28__\nYeah, I think that is definitely a good way to do it.\n\n__Noah Macdonald 2:32__\nAnd most importantly, is to continue just being myself.\n\n__Megan Fanok 2:41__\nYeah, that's awesome! Do you have anything else you'd like to say about the project and what it's meant for you?\n\n__Noah Macdonald 2:46__\nI find it's been a great experience digging into the year 2040 and doing a lot of research and I'm excited to share it with everyone. Expect the website to go live in mid-late April and should be fully featured by then. So expect articles, videos, maybe a podcast - I can't quite remember. Expect all kinds of different deliverables to look through and enjoy.\n\n__Megan Fanok 3:11__\nAwesome. Well, I'm excited to see the website. Thank you so much for meeting me with me. Sorry. Thank you so much for meeting with me. It was great talking to you about the project!\n\n__Noah Macdonald 3:20__\nYeah! It was it was great talking with you."

I'm a junior chemical engineering major in cohort nine and as she said, our project is about envisioning 2040.\n\n__Sofia Stout 0:26__\nYeah. So what can you tell us about the project? And why is it important?\n\n__Phillip Loges 0:30__\nSo our project, Envision 2040, is about thinking ahead and being more proactive toward your future, specifically, more than next 20 years. And it's important because many people don't really realize how much change we're seeing in short periods of time. And our technological advancements are growing at an exponential rate now and a world is even seeing them demographic shifts. So it's important for people to keep up with those times. And if you look back at it, people are now holding supercomputers that are better than what NASA sent people to the moon on and they're holding those in their pockets. And these people are seeing these changes in those people alive right now that had car phones, which nobody really knows what they are anymore. So we're seeing advancements like never before. And specifically, my topic in our project is about what kind of future tech we will see integrated into our daily lives. And we're focusing on Elon Musk's neural link a little bit. And soon we'll be seeing technologies such as small brain chips that are integrated into our daily lives based on where they can tell us our wellness, they can, you know, basically, just help us throughout our daily lives with small little tasks and give us diagnoses. And it's important that people don't just sit back and fall behind in a rapidly changing world, it's important to look at it and start to be proactive thinking towards what it's going to be. So that's one of the reasons I think it is most important for people to experience our project and start to envision what life they will be living in 2040.\n\n__Sofia Stout 2:15__\nDefinitely. So you've already shared some insights. But maybe what are some other insights or ideas you've gained from this project?\n\n__Phillip Loges 2:22__\nYes, so majority of the insights I've gained around the ideas of a massive demographic shift, and a very digital future. So by 2040, there's gonna be a huge change in demographic, the work world is going to look different. There's going to be so much more diversity inclusion throughout the entire world. I believe the white population will no longer be the majority in the world as a major demographic change that we'll see. And as well as coming out of COVID, with everything going online, people saying that you can work from home, you can do everything digitally, we see a more digital style of work, and people are going to start realizing you can do more with the technology that you have than what you're already doing.\n\n__Sofia Stout 3:16__\nAbsolutely. So last question, what are you personally doing to prepare for the future?\n\n__Phillip Loges 3:22__\nPersonally, I am being proactive in educating myself. I'm watching and listening to TED talks and podcasts and watching videos, going on to different news sites to see what's going on in the world right now, what's coming out, not just looking at one specific news outlet, but I'm going to international news outlets. Because oftentimes, just the national, you know, domestic news outlets aren't telling you everything else that's going on the world. So it's an important thing I think other people should also do is branch out and try and figure out what else is happening in this world. Don't wait till the information comes to you. I'm going to the information and finding it for myself.\n\n__Sofia Stout 4:05__\nAwesome. Yeah. Thank you so much. We're looking forward to when your project launches!\n\n__Phillip Loges 4:10__\nThank you!"

I'm a sophomore\nmechanical engineering student at Lockheed Martin Leadership Institute. Natalie would\nyou like to introduce yourself?\n\n__Natalie Nguyen 0:15__\nYes! Hi, everyone, my name is Natalie Nguyen,\nand I'm currently a junior, majoring in biomedical engineering. I'm in cohort nine of the Lockheed Martin Leadership Institute.\n\n__Raymond Pugh 0:30__\nOkay! So, Natalie, I heard you are working\non Envision 2040. Could you explain what that is and why this Envision 2040 project is important?\n\n__Natalie Nguyen 0:40__\nYeah. So like every junior year of the cohort in the Leadership Institute, we do a big project. And cohort seven did an amazing job on digital transformation, cohort eight also did an amazing job on embracing change. And they kind of viewed a good foundation for our topic, which is Envision 2040 to like to do on that. So how do we do that? We kind of by envisioning the future, and preparing ourselves for the future ahead of time, we broke down our topic into several sub topics and analyzed them through three lenses: advancement in technology, embracing diversity and inclusion, and human interactions. We know that we are no experts on this topic, but no sub no sub topic can only be viewed through one lens, and we would like to contribute our understanding and our fresh views on these topics.\n\n__Raymond Pugh 1:41__\nThat's pretty good. What insights I've got from exploring your topic?\n\n__Natalie Nguyen 1:48__\nWhat I'm focusing on right now is the diversity and inclusion, inclusion demographics. So we all know that the benefits of diversity and inclusion is that they boost the creativity of the employees, and it provides a better customer service, higher job satisfaction, and they also give companies a higher stock prices and lower litigation expenses. But managing a diverse workforce is challenging because like age demographic traits, such as gender, race, religion, disabilities, or sexual orientation, each face unique challenges. So why is it important to look at the demographics of diversity and inclusion? By looking at the demographics of that, we'll help the companies realize if they are managing their diversity in their company effectively or not. So if not, they can start the practices to improve the diversity, such as building a culture\nof respecting diversity, creating diversity training programs, or review that recruitment practices.\n\n__Raymond Pugh 2:58__\nThat's amazing! And what are you going to do to prepare for this for the future?\n\n__Natalie Nguyen 3:05__\nSo I think the most important part to prepare for the future is embracing the changes, because we never know what the future will look like,we can only envision the future, but we cannot know exactly what would happen in the future. Like when the pandemic hit all around the world, like a year ago, we didn't know what to do. But like, when we embrace the changes, we cannot, get to be a new normal, like working from home is the new normal right now. And we all know that like automation will be like a big part of us like in the future. And we cannot deny that machines will be an important part of our future. So we can only do what we can only learn the suitable skills to prepare for our future, like learning skills relating to machines, so that we will not be afraid to be replaced in the future. And I think that the last part is focused on our main\ngoals, and don't waste our time on things we cannot control like the pandemic.\n\n__Raymond Pugh 4:20__\nThat's great. That's great advice. Thank you so much!\n\n__Natalie Nguyen 4:24__\nYeah, no problem. Thank you!\n"

And today I'm interviewing Julia Schaeffer, a member of Cohort 9 within Lockheed Martin Leadership Institute.\n\n__Julia Schaeffer  0:12__  \nHi Will, thanks for having me.\n\n__Will Landman  0:13__  \nYeah, it's pleasure to have you here. Today we're gonna be talking about Cohort nine's project Envision 2040 that they've been working on all year. And what it is and why it's important in today's climate, so Julia, like I said, if you could talk a little bit about why Envision 2040 is important, and just a brief overview of what it is?\n\n__Julia Schaeffer  0:32__  \nOf course, Envision 2040 is our website that we've been working on. And it's basically a website that's focused on 2040. We've taken a look at the future. And we want to see what it's going to be like, we are making predictions. And we're also taking in ideas about how our human relationships will change as well. In addition to how technology will change and how it'll change, like in relation to technology, it's very much about how we can not only think about the future, but also make individual changes. And think about things like advancements in technology, and embracing inclusion and human interaction in a long term individual and a global perspective as well.\n\n__Will Landman  1:17__  \nThat's awesome. I like how you guys are really encapsulating not only what your predictions are, but what you can do with those predictions, because ultimately those predictions wouldn't really mean anything if you didn't know what to do with them. So that's awesome. You guys are doing that. Yeah. So next, what are some insights that you personally have gained through this process of developing Envision 2040, whether that be insights about the future or insights about the collaborative process, developing the website or other aspects like that.\n\n__Julia Schaeffer  1:44__  \nI've really learned a lot from being able to interact with like the other members of the cohort, of Cohort 9, and seeing all how their research interacts, and intersects with mine a lot with them personally working on accessibility with my partner. And just seeing how that overlaps so much with the other aspects and seeing how we can sort of add that and make that something that is important to our project overall. And just showing the big picture. And like I said, working with how the different how the changes in human interaction and communication is just going to be, has changed so much, and it's going to keep changing, and how we can sort of impact it ourselves and think about everything, overall in the big picture as well.\n\n__Will Landman  2:39__  \nYeah, I really like how you're talking about the collaborative aspect of that, and how different areas intersect with each other, and ultimately will play with each other in the future. I think a lot of times people think about individual aspects of the future, like you said, like transportation or accessibility, and not really how they could intersect with other aspects. Because ultimately, when we get to 2040, those things that will be interacting, it's important to plan for it. So yeah, the next question I have for you is what are you personally doing to change for the future or prepare for the future?\n\n__Julia Schaeffer  3:12__  \nAs I did research, for predictions for the next 20 years, I also looked back and sort of saw everybody's predictions from 20 years ago, or even just like a couple years ago, and how many were both right and wrong. And just seeing the difference in opinions and how much did change overall. And it should show just how it's important to think and plan and make predictions and sort of prepare, but also to take a step back and be aware that you're gonna have to adapt and adapt anyway, that you have to embrace the change as a previous project was of Cohort 8. And just be prepared, but also adapt. Prepare to adapt.\n\n__Will Landman  3:58__  \nThat's awesome. It was great hearing from you about some more about what Envision 2040 is, and I'm looking forward to like you said, seeing the progress of those models be uploaded to the website and to the ultimate project. I'm sure it'll be amazing. Thanks so much for Yeah, thanks so much for reaching out and talking to you about this. It was pleasure to talk to you. I'm super excited to hear about.\n\n__Julia Schaeffer  4:19__  \nIt was great to talk to you too. I appreciate being able to share.\n\n__Will Landman  4:22__  \nAwesome"

I'm a sophomore studying mechanical engineering at Miami University. I'm a member of the cohort 10 of Lockheed Martin Leadership Institute here at Miami University. And today we will be discussing Envision 2040 with a Aversa Prentosito. Aversa, how are you doing today?\n\n__Aversa Prentosito  0:19__\nHi! I'm good. Yeah, I'm Aversa. I'm a junior computer science student at Miami, and I'm in cohort nine of the Lockheed Martin Leadership Institute.\n\n__Brandon Mammano  0:31__  \nAwesome. So today we're talking about the Envision 2040 projects. So why is this Envision 2040 project important?\n\n__Aversa Prentosito  0:41__  \nIt's important because there will be a lot of changes between now and 2040. And we want to look at what some of those changes might be and how to adapt to change. Previous cohorts topics were embracing change and digital transformation. And we've built upon those within our project. Envision 2040 is about how we embrace change in the digital transformation over the next 20 years. The way we'll do this is by envisioning what the future will look like and preparing ourselves for that future ahead of time, we're trying to see what we as individuals can do to implement these ideas into our own daily lives.\n\n__Brandon Mammano  1:26__  \nThat's awesome. So working on this, what insights Have you gotten in exploring this topic?\n\n__Aversa Prentosito  1:34__  \nSo my cohort broke our topic down into sub topics and analyze them through three lenses, advancements in technology, embracing inclusion and human interaction. advancements in technology is focused on how technological capabilities will shift our daily lives. Embracing inclusion is focused on what we do from now, up through 2040. And this helps to ensure we're ready to engage in a more inclusive workplace because 2040 is going to be a diverse environment with people from a lot of different backgrounds. And then lastly, human interaction is focused on looking at how humans will be interacting and communicating with one another. With the rapid improvements in technology, and diversification of the workplace. So an example of this that we saw in the past year is the shift to remote instruction in the classroom. We didn't even imagine this two years ago, but it's what we're all experiencing today. And in this project, we're looking into what we expect will occur 20 years from now, this example is related to what I've explored within the topic of vision 2040, I've delved more into increased technology use within education. This is within the human interaction lens. But all the lenses are interconnected. My subtopic can be viewed through other lenses as well. So technologies within education is within the human interaction lens. Because as we see, currently, technology has impacted how we communicate with one another within educational settings. But it could also be within the advancements in technology lens, because technological advancements such as virtual reality advancements will affect how students are taught and how teachers teach. And it can also be within the third lens: embracing inclusion. Because technology, such as technology for disabled students, will allow those students to have a greater ability to learn. So by looking through these lenses, I've gained insights on how technology can impact education in the future.\n\n__Brandon Mammano  4:02__  \nThat's awesome. Those breakdowns are great. Okay, so my last question for you is, what are you going to do to prepare for the future?\n\n__Aversa Prentosito  4:12__  \nA big thing to think about with all of our learning is what we're going to do to prepare for what's to come. Future thinking is a good thing. It allows us to imagine what kind of future we want to live in and how we can get there. So by thinking ahead, and having goals in mind, we're more likely to reach them. You'll also be better prepared for when things come up in the future. Future thinking is also good in transforming the way we think by thinking about the future and all the possibilities, we'll start thinking about opportunities and the way to achieve goals we envision.\n\n__Brandon Mammano  4:58__  \nWow, all of those insights are so helpful when looking into this program and what it's all about. So, thank you so much for your time today Aversa. And I hope you have a great day and thank you very much.\n\n__Aversa Prentosito  5:11__  \nThank you!"

I am a member of Cohort 10 in the Lockheed Martin Leadership Institute, today I am talking with Tate Owens, a junior studying computer engineering in Miami University. How you doing today?\n\n__Tate Owens 0:23__\nI'm doing pretty good. How are you doing?\n\n__Micheal Amoah 0:25__\nI'm doing well. So my first question is, why is the Envision 2040 project important?\n\n__Tate Owens 0:32__\nAlright, so the important stems in a few different areas. But primarily, what how we develop this project was we realized after the COVID crisis that we really got caught with our feet flat on the ground, we weren't able to move with the rapid changes in technology and the rapid changes in like, social interactions. So what we realized is we need to like better be able to prepare ourselves to adapt to the changes that are coming in the future. So from like our previous projects, in the past years of embracing change and digital transformation, we kind of took those and we're like, hey, how can we make those work together to ensure that everybody here can be prepared to embrace these changes and technology and social interaction and diversity and inclusion, and like, be able to take a running start at them as they're popping up, and especially in 2040, as like milestone, because that's 20 years in the future. So we have some time to prepare, but we have to prepare now. So that's like where I it's important is just being prepared. So we don't get caught behind again and have to go through this big catch up phase like we did at the beginning of the pandemic.\n\n__Micheal Amoah 1:44__\nYeah, that's, that's really important. That preparation is really important. So what insights have you gotten from exploring this topic?\n\n__Tate Owens 1:53__\nSo after doing a lot of research about what's going to be forecasted for 2040? And what kind of are the key players that are going to be changes that like, we don't have right now that will be completely different in 2040. And we realized that we can kind of look at it through three different lenses. So we have our basic advancements in technology. So what are phones going to be like? How are we going to communicate just general technology. And then on top of that, we have the human factor. So those are the other two lenses. So we have diversity and inclusion. So how can we embrace inclusion and be able to not like, get caught? Like where we are right now? We're like, we're having issues like getting along and being able to work together with people who have different perspectives, as you do? So how can we prepare now to, like, be ready to just be fully inclusive when the workforce is going to be like, there isn't going to be differences, because everybody's going to be different? So that's our second lens. And then our third lens is human interaction. So how are we going to interact when we could be working across different oceans and like, well, because like, we've seen that this year, how like, we're becoming a more worldwide community where like we're working together from, like us, right now you're in New York, and I'm in Oxford, Ohio is like, so how are we going to be able to still have meaningful human interactions? And like, be kind to one another? Well, we're hiding behind screens. We're not interacting in the traditional, like, physical way, of like going out to get a bite to eat together.\n\n__Micheal Amoah 0:05__\nYeah, that's, that's really interesting. And last thing is, what are you personally going to do to prepare for the future?\n\n__Tate Owens 3:36__\nSo personally, I just, I'm looking for perspective. So through these different lenses, I'm creating different perspectives. And I'm seeing how other people can see it just by like researching. So what different futurists thinker is going to look like what different futurists, how they're going to prepare themselves. And a couple weeks, we're going to hear from Jeff Wilcox, and he's going to talk about his perspective on how he can prepare and like what he believes that is important to prepare for in the future. So like, part of gaining perspective is doing research. So I'm going to be doing a lot of research, a lot of reading, and just kind of researching, like, how these are set out to change and how I can better embrace these changes as I'm moving with them. So I can keep moving and not get caught flat footed.\n\n__Micheal Amoah 4:24__\nRight. Thank you, Tate. It was very interesting to hear about Envision 2040. Thank you very much.\n\n__Tate Owens 4:30__\nNo problem."

How are you today Nhi?\n\n__Nhi Nguyen 0:23__\nGood, how about you?\n\n__Micheal Siino 0:24__\nI'm doing well. Thanks. So today, I'm going to be asking you a few questions about 2040. If that's all right. Yeah. Alright, so first, why don't you tell me why the Envision 2040 project is important?\n\n__Nhi Nguyen 0:39__\nWell, the world is changing every day. And it is changing more rapidly than ever. So it is important for us to prepare and adapt to the change in the future. Our project Envision 2040 is built on the foundation of the two previous projects of the Lockheed Martin Leadership Institute, which are embracing change and digital transformation. So by envisioning the future, what it will look like we can reveal ourselves and learn to adapt to and embrace change in the digital transformation over the next 20 years.\n\n__Micheal Siino 1:23__\nAll right. So next, I'm going to ask, what insights have you gained in exploring the topic of what the world is going to look like in the year 2040.\n\n__Nhi Nguyen 1:39__\nI'm working on the aspect of diversity and inclusion. So what we have learned about the demographics is there will be a huge shift in the workspace. There will be less white Americans and more Hispanic, Asian, and black people in a workspace, there will also be an increase of women and women CEO. The age of the workspace will also increase, people will be more likely to work until they are 70. And just by looking at the demography, we also figure out how to help these different groups work well together.\n\n__Micheal Siino 2:38__\nRight, that's all really interesting. And lastly, what are you doing personally prepare yourself for that future.\n\n__Nhi Nguyen 2:48__\nI think the most important thing is self-reflection. First, I need to know what is keeping me from adapting to the new future, such as hidden bias, and stereotypes. Learning about new technologies also helps. Because I think it is better for us to use technologies for our work instead of having our work change because of them. The last thing is meeting new people. I believe that meeting people from different groups is the best way to learn about empathy, to embrace diversity, and so be inclusive.\n\nAll right, well, thank you for meeting with me today.\n\n__Nhi Nguyen 3:33__\nThank you for listening too.\n\n__Micheal Siino 3:35__\nAlright, have a nice day!\n\n__Nhi Nguyen 3:38__\nYou too!"

So today we're going to be talking about Envision 2040. And before we get into it, I'll introduce myself. So I'm Manas Shringare and I'm a computer science major at Miami University. And I'm also a part of Cohort 10 at the Lockheed Martin Leadership Institute. And today we are talk and discuss about Envision 2040. With Eunice handing it over to you.\n\n__Eunice Nsaam 0:31__\nHello, my name is Eunice Nsaam I'm part of the Leadership Institute of Cohort 9. I'm currently a junior studying bioengineering.\n\n__Manas Shringare 0:42__\nGreat. Let's get into the questions. Okay, so talking about Envision 2014. Tell us, Eunice, why is the Envision 2040 project important?\n\n__Eunice Nsaam 0:55__\nSo I would say this project is important, in order for us to start to think about if we haven't already, the kind of future that may be approaching us and how we could be ready for it. So some of the Leadership Institute projects from the past have explored concepts of embracing change and digital transformation. And this project essentially allows for further exploration of these concepts or ideas in a more futuristic sense.\n\n__Manas Shringare 1:22__\nYeah, that's really great to hear about and get to know more about. Thanks. Moving on to the next question. Tell us like, what insights have you gotten in exploring this topic?\n\n__Eunice Nsaam 1:36__\nSo I'll say of the few topics that we will be showcasing on the Envision 2040 website, I worked on the accessibility topic with one of my cohort colleagues. And I'm personally becoming more and more aware of how very inaccessible some of our technologies are. And I think that for the coming years, this is an area that is certainly worth investing more time and effort into. So when we talk about recruiting some of the best minds for certain positions when we talk about, you know, helping someone to reach your fullest potential reach some of their goals. When you think about it, though, improving access to technology is directly an advantage to people with disabilities. I would think that it's often overlooked that the fact that the success of this improvement is kind of also reflected in how much further we can move on as a society in terms of our innovative developments and advancements.\n\n__Manas Shringare 2:31__\nWow, that's really great to hear. Must've been an interesting process, like just walking through it, getting to know more about it, and growing through it.\n\n__Eunice Nsaam 2:39__\nYeah, exactly.\n\n__Manas Shringare 2:41__\nIt's great. Going on to a final one, probably, I think, the most important one, what are you going to do to prepare for the future.\n\n__Eunice Nsaam 2:52__\nSo personally, I think it has a lot to do it kind of like preparing oneself first before kind of like going out there to help others. So prepare and prepare for the future, I plan on kind of working more towards understanding myself, you know, equipping myself with some of those helpful skills and pieces of knowledge that I gathered from my experiences, through learning from others, and allowing myself to be more open minded about situations that come my way. So some questions I could ask myself are, how can I start addressing any bias I have towards different groups of people around me what tools whether they're technical or personal, do I need to start obtaining now in order to achieve a goal that I'm passionate about? Especially through doing this project, I hope others will also kind of start thinking about these some of these questions or reflecting on themselves in this way, as well. And I've also come to realize that as we work with people and kind of build all these technological instruments to help people, we often have to overlook some of the cultural and emotional intelligence that accompanies that. And I think it would be in our very best interest to focus in on some of these ideas in our tech spaces, especially.\n\n__Manas Shringare 4:06__\nReally great to hear Eunice how much you're going to be taken away from this. And how it really like was a big part of your time at the Lockheed Institute.\n\n__Eunice Nsaam 4:16__\nYeah, this is definitely like a really important project and it's really cool. Kind of going through the different steps of it. Really excited.\n\n__Manas Shringare 4:25__\nGreat, wait to hear about it, get to know more about it and how we talk over it. Awesome. Thank you so much.\n\n__Eunice Nsaam 4:32__\nYeah, thank you for having me.\n\n__Manas Shringare 4:34__\nDefinitely. It's always a pleasure."

And I have\nAbby Ray of Cohort 9 here with me to talk about her Cohort's project Envision 2040. I have a few quick questions whenever you're ready.\n\n__Abby Ray 0:17__\nAmazing, yeah!\n\n__Catherine Avart 0:17__\nSo the first question is, why is the Envision 2040 project important?\n\n__Abby Ray 0:23__\nYeah, so the previous two cohorts before mine, their big projects looked at embracing change, and the upcoming digital transformation. So we wanted our topic to kind of address how we can embrace change in the imminent digital transformation over the next 20 years, because, you know, with all the research we've done, we've realized that there's a lot that is going to change within the next 20 years, and specifically in the three topics that we've kind of broken our project up into, which is advancements in technology, embracing inclusion and human interaction. So our we really wanted to focus on like, how we can we know, all these things are happening. And we know that they're gonna change life as we know it, and how we interact together and what, you know, work looks like. But we really want to help to prepare people for when all this change happens.\n\n__Catherine Avart 1:27__\nAnd so then the second question I have is, what insights have you gotten in exploring this topic? And I guess more specifically, part of your project that you're specifically working on?\n\n__Abby Ray 1:42__\nYeah, so I am paired up with Rachel Duke, and we're focusing on allyship, which is within the embracing inclusion, subtopic. And something that, with all the research we've done, we realize how much demographic of our nation is going to shift within the next 20 years. So one of the biggest things is that our current minorities, that we know of today are actually going to shift to the majority, which is very interesting to think about, but what we're exploring is how does that shift affect how we work with each other? And what are the ways we can create a more cohesive and understanding in an inclusive environment within the workforce?\n\n__Catherine Avart 2:28__\nThat's great to hear. That's really good to hear. And so then my last question for you is, what are you going to do to prepare for the future?\n\n__Abby Ray 2:39__\nUm, I think personally, what I am learning\nis, especially in terms of allyship, but what I can be preparing for is being open-minded and willing to learn, as we've explored through allyship and you know, learning about others around us is the best allyship is a journey. It's not a, there's no real end goal. There's no way to like say, here's your certificate, you're now an ally. It's constantly learning, evolving and with the goal of wanting to understand others and be the best either, you know, partner, peer, you name it, best teammate possible by trying to understand others.\n\n__Catherine Avart 3:27__\nReally cool I really appreciate all your insights that you've given me today. Thank you so much for your time. And good luck with your cohorts.\n\n__Abby Ray 3:39__\nThank you, and thank you for taking the time\nto talk to me.\n\n__Catherine Avart 3:44__\nHave a good day. \n\n__Abby Ray 3:45__\nYou too."

So let's dive right in and talk about why you feel that this project and Envision 2040 is important.\n\n__Will Cotter  0:25__  \nYeah, that's great question. Envision 2040 is really important for two facets. The first one is that we know that 2040 is going to look a lot different than it does right now. And the second is, how can we be able to change that? And how can we be able to change what 2040 will look like and change the path to make it both a more efficient and safe path moving forward? After the COVID-19 pandemic, it really shifted everybody's viewpoints, on life and routine. And with that, everything else will shift to so we want to take a proactive approach at envisioning what that will be. And we want to also try to change that image for the better.\n\n__Audrey Rabick  1:06__  \nAwesome, those are two really big topics. Could you talk a little bit more on some specific insights that meant a lot to you?\n\n__Will Cotter  1:14__  \nYeah, sure. Since I've been here in Buffalo co-oping, I've actually been able to see firsthand about how COVID-19 has changed a lot of business practices and how not only has it changed the immediate, but now that we've gotten more into it, we're able to see how life is changing about how companies are changing more so for the future, that is not just the lockdowns, but things are going more much more online, the use of Microsoft team meetings are much more prevalent. And we're only going to see that life is going to become more of not machines, replacing humans. But how humans react to machines taking over these roles, how are we able to use machines to be more efficient? And with that, how are we able to see the human side of it as well? How are we able to make sure that we stay connected with people, it's all really important topics that is really important about Envision 2040 in this project?\n\n__Audrey Rabick  2:15__  \nThat sounds delightful. Um, so let's let's hone it in a little bit more with what you think you're going to do to prepare for that future that's discussed in Envision 2040?\n\n__Will Cotter  2:29__  \nGreat question. Preparing for the future is not an easy question. And it's not an easy thought, considering that with the future comes the idea of uncertainty. But with uncertainty comes opportunity. And with that being said, opportunity is really important, because we want to be able to not just continue what what we have known and what businesses have known but we want to be able to look at our generation, and with other generations be able to push the envelope and make a make our industries as engineers as computer scientists, even more, even more technologically sound and even more efficient, even more safe and the ways that we can. And so for me preparing for that I've actually been able to with the position I have right now, but also been able to see how everything is changing at a different rate. Everything is changing much quicker. Everything is everything moves faster. Now that we've gone through that pandemic, so for me, I would say trying to grasp trying to just observe and deposit everything after the COVID-19 pandemic has been huge.\n\n__Audrey Rabick  3:42__  \nExcellent, great answer. Great response. Thanks again for meeting with me and thanks to everyone watching. I am so excited to see what the projects brings to us.\n\n__Will Cotter  3:53__  \nAs am I, thank you for having me."

So hi, today we are talking about the book, \"Thinking in the Future Tense,\" by Jennifer James. My name is Rebecca Gruenberg, and today with me is Taylor Owens, Ethan Cunningham, and Evan Franzman.\n\nSo we're just going to do a brief introduction as to why thinking in the future tense is important. Really a lot of people view the future with fear and dread, which is related a lot to all the change that goes into that. This book really provides a missing framework for analyzing and organizing all of the life events and all the changes that organizations and people as a whole go through. And while it's aimed at managers and business professionals, and while it was written in 1996, it still has a lot of applications today. Especially with the Cyber Age that we're entering and the continual technological changes that we see every day.\n\nSo the very first skill talked about in the book is \"Seeing with New Eyes.\" What this really refers to is perspective. We can't experience the future until it becomes the present, so a lot of the things that we believe about the future really aren't going to be able to hold up. And in order to do so, we have to use our perspective in order to think clearly about this unknown future. That involves going through all the positives and negatives of issues, see how parts relate to the whole, interpreting change, and adapting to it effectively and productively, and also creating new possibilities from them. Losing perspective can come from too much information or too much complexity which is really an issue in today's world, but feeling overloaded like that is totally normal. So let's go ahead and look at what distorts our perspectives and why we should keep these mind traps at the fore-front of our minds. So self-righteousness is the first thing that can distort perspective, and it's really asking \"you can be right,\" or \"you can know what's really happening.\" You have to be able to confront your preconceived beliefs and everything else that you believe going into the future in order to understand how you can adapt and change. Similarly, age. Many adults cling to the past and that's why children are always seen as visionaries because age can really pile up those negative experiences. So having that perspective about how your age changes, you can help to dial it back and view the future with a little bit more optimism. Gender. There's a lot of differences in sexualities and with women versus men in really more prominent roles being desensitized as weird in modern society. And gender perspectives really come down to a level of respect which is always something to keep in mind. Similarly, class. A lot of class systems create an inability to work or live together easily in these large communities, which are only becoming more complex. And then finally electronic media can distort our perspectives. We lose the ability to concentrate and sympathize because TV and computers are addictive. And of course modern-day, the issue more than anything are our cell phones. \n\n**3:09**\nSo the next skill is \"Recognizing the Future,\" and what that really refers to is pattern recognition, specifically. Patterns are mental maps that can lead us to visionary ideas. We really need an eye for information and clues, so that we can understand new patterns and trends. Managers especially need to be aware of patterns so that they can track changes in products and in markets because there are fads. But there are also long-term trends, and it's important to recognize that difference. Trends are often driven by increased complexity and customization, miniaturization, multitasking, and then growing interest in adaptability for the mind and the body. Predicting change comes from these six ideas. The first one is extension, and it's really just asking, \"How will innovations affect the way society is organized?\" You know, \"How will they affect us now versus later?\" Elaboration is kind of \"What part of a business or service can be elaborated upon?\" \"How can it be further developed?\" Recycling is just when old patterns or trends make a comeback. So it's asking yourself, \"How can we revive this old trend?\" Pattern reversals: that's really just a normal playing out of tensions between opposites. So it's just thinking about how the same way we always think we're going to move forward, trends will reverse the same way that we do. There are strange attractions and those are odd combinations to look out for. And finally chaos, which is just unpredictability in a lot of complex forms, which is why it's important to let yourself play with unlikely possibilities and really use some visualization techniques.\n\n**Evan Franzman 4:51**\nJumping into skill three here, it's going to be \"Harnessing the Power of Myths and Symbols.\" So the first question I asked when I read this chapter was, you know, \"What are myths and symbols?\" Is it the stuff, you know, we read in fables, that kind of thing? And it's not really that. Myths are threads that are linked to the past and they shape the perception of the present. They're often idealized and exaggerated, hyperbolic, and they represent deeply held beliefs and perceptions of a specific community or culture. Whereas symbols are kind of a summary of the myths that it represents, so they're an outward sign of an inward belief. They're very prevalent in language, (oops, you might go back there for me) very prevalent language, but difficult to find thoughts without symbols. So words can symbolize different meanings. For example, whimp is one that they use in the book, and that's somebody who's kind of weaker. So we go to the next slide. Now, we talk about the more important thing which is myth switches. So it's important for a leader to understand when myths are switching. So it's important to notice changes, old myths being uprooted, often cause a passion that distracts from the change in the air. So people are often deep-rooted in their beliefs, and so it's important to kind of notice these changes so the uprooting doesn't cause a passion. So some coaching styles, examples, they had in the book were humiliation versus motivation, like strategy and teamwork, and hiring practices shifted from humiliation to motivation over the course of, you know, several decades. A new one that's kind of coming up in the 90's they talked about, was like the idea of a global village, kind of having globalization. We can see now that it's very prevalent. Everything's super connected now. Back then, people, they cited examples of Chinese women using American style. I think anybody can use any style now. And back then they also talked about people who had negative reactions to it calling it \"cultural pollution.\" As a company, it's important to tread lightly and respect and adopt cultures with overseas clients. Just a note they made. The last thing was it's really important for leaders to recognize myth switches. You don't want to be caught using an outdated myth. You know, back in before Jim Crow times, it was okay to be racist. Now, it's definitely not okay. You don't want to be caught using an outdated myth. \n\n**7:02**\nAnd so the next slide, \"Speeding Up Your Response Time.\" So this has to do with embracing change, something we talked about last year. So this is a brief background on the process of change. You know change as we all know, is constant, unrelenting, doesn't care who you are. How do we keep up as individuals? It's important to understand the processes of cultural change. So here's kind of a list of what cultural evolution is. You have innovation, diffusion, cultural loss, acculturation, outside control, and then trade, travel, communication. I won't go over these too much, because they're not as important as the next two slides here which are the styles of change. And so one that we're really familiar with is incremental change. That's the most common type. It's little steps that gradually add up to a huge change, so slow we hardly notice. Examples they had were like exercising or developing a skill like coding or something like that. And the steps for this are, you know, you see this window, something just clicks, you're aware that you're kind of developing it. You explore, gather information about it, get prepared. You try and integrate parts of it into your life, and so you really fully commit and plunge into it. It's short, scary, you have feelings of doubt. You know you're nervous that this is really the right step. You eventually have the landing phase where you feel like you're on solid ground. You're on the right track and then afterwards you evaluate. You have some retrospective on what you could do better going forward. And then the second style was systemic shifts. This is like the more futuristic style of change. So it's appropriate for fast and comprehensive response, in business especially. It's a total transformation, not gradual at all. It's a 180-degree turn. So you're completely shifting everything. Two books that kind of talk a lot about this that I encourage you to go read if you're more interested in this is \"The Anatomy of an Illness,\" and \"In Search of Excellence.\" Two things I mentioned in the book is resources. The big thing about this style of change is, you know, if you're a leader, people you're leading, and you can even see this in yourself, is that people can feel threatened by this sudden shift and huge shift. You know, I'm talented in the situation I'm in now, but you know, I'm not so sure about the situation we're going towards. How do I kind of prepare? So that's just kind of something you have to focus on.\n\n**Ethan Cunningham 9:05**\nAnd moving into skill five is \"Understanding the Past to Know the Future.\" And so the first problem is with nostalgia. And it's where we remember the good things and we forget the rough things. And a perfect example is like remembering the warmth of the cabin and forgetting how cold it was in the outhouse, right? And so this presents a clear resistance to change. This is the way things have always been. This is the way they should be. It's how we've always done it. And really it goes back to this great belief in a great past and a lackluster future. That, you know, you think about the good old days, the glory days, and that the future is just not looking so bright. How to practically expose yourself in this false belief is like if you go back and re-watch your favorite childhood TV show. I guarantee you if you go back and look you're like, \"Wow, this is not the quality I remember it being, and things have definitely gotten better.\" Next slide, please. And so one driver of this resistance is lodge cultures and company cultures. And basically what they do is impose outdated standards on new members, and they also limit acceptance to conserve power. And so we're thinking like physicians, politicians, academics, religions, this like, \"Oh you have to have four years of academic experience to move into this job.\" Which may not always be the case, because you can learn things, you can be capable without specific certifications. And so ultimately it suppresses opposing thought and disincentivizes taking risks. And so next slide please. \n\n**10:40**\nAnd then we talk about skill number six, \"Doing More with More or Less.\" And so on the next slide, we think of the effects of security. And so security is defined as a feeling of being able to survive and prosper, and the lack of security brings anxiety, insecurity, right? And so as this insecurity increases, or your security decreases, the competition is gonna increase, right? And so we think time is money, and so like we're gonna sleep less. And you can see over time, we sleep less than past generations. And what we're moving into is from a manual to a mental labor. And so you think like agricultural society to corporate office type society. It also is making effects in like our day-to-day life. We think of stereotype versus empathy. It was okay to think like, \"Oh this person is of this demographic, so they're like this.\" And now we know that's not the case, but it actually takes more mental labor to empathize with the person's situation. And so we can also see that with physical work and anxiety and thinking like, \"Okay, my manual labor, like digging ditches all day, is a lot of physical work, but now we're moving into this mental labor, of this anxiety, which uses a lot of mental energy.\" And then creating insecurity to increase motivation and avoiding anxiety to increase security are kind of ways we kind of cope with trying to drive competition or feel more secure, but they're not sustainable. And then on the next slide, we talk about optimizing energy, okay. And so, these are just a few of many tactics, but two-way work relationships create more energy than one-way. And so in a one-way relationship, at least as far as work goes, you might think of fear and intimidation as a motivator, but you're just using that unsustainable anxiety and you're actually wasting energy, mental energy, that you could use for something else. Technology saves time and energy as long as you're comfortable using it. And so the learning curve might be steep, and that's why we resist that change, but the net time profit will pay off. And then some kind of like subcategories under that, technology is like allowing customers to do work like pumping their own gas, ordering online or from a kiosk like at McDonald's, or self-checkouts at a grocery store. So that way we're not wasting labor time. And then to finish this out, like pushing your skills and leaving old work to subordinates is like the idea that maybe a nurse is capable of doing certain jobs that the doctor can do, but just because they don't have the certification like usually they're told not to do that. And so in the future, we can look at pushing skills and leaving like old work to them. And finally lifelong learning, continuing education becomes more prominent, and just the fact that you can always have a growth mindset and continue to develop your skills in your work.\n\n**Taylor Owens 13:49**\nAll right so moving on, we have skill seven which is \"Mastering New Forms of Intelligence.\" This goes on with what Ethan was saying about the growth mindset and finding areas to improve. So first up we have Howard Gardner's Eight Primary Forms of Intelligence. So Gardner developed this list of eight forms of intelligence, so you can determine where you can improve and where you're lacking in your skills. So the first one is verbal and linguistic, which is like your communication. The second one is logical and mathematical, which is your ability to solve logic and mathematical equations. This is more scientific. And then there's your visual and spatial, which is your ability to visualize your solutions to the problems and be able to kind of create an image of what you would like to do. There's body and kinesthetic which is how you're going to physically respond to problems and how you're going to be able to make your body work and respond correctly and efficiently. And then we have five is musical and rhythmic, which is the ability to incorporate sounds and music into your ability to solve problems and be able to utilize that to decrease stress and improve your mood while you're working. And then interpersonal is your strong, intuitive skills and your ability to read the room. So this is being able to tell whether the people around you are upset, happy, amused, be able to know if you're doing a good job. And then intrapersonal is the ability to understand character and personality. So this takes a little bit more depth and being able to kind of see how people react and how you react personally and use that to your advantage to be able to work better with others while also being more efficient. And then moral and spiritual is a hybrid of interpersonal and intrapersonal, and this is more along the lines of what you believe is right and why you think it's right. You could be a religious person or not, it's just kind of where your moral beliefs stem from and whether you're strong in those or weak. And then the author added in a ninth bonus form of intelligence which is practical, and this is like your common sense or street smarts. So this is seen in a lot of people who like to reverse engineer, tear stuff apart to see how it works, so that way they can kind of move forward and know something that might not be teachable. \n\n**16:12**\nAll right, so moving on to skill 8 we have \"Profiting from Diversity.\" The key thing to think of when talking about diversity is that it's not just race. A lot of people will just focus on race being the only form of diversity. Another key form is gender, along with many other areas just like depending on how somebody's background was growing up and how it is currently, people come from all different walks of life and that's a very important thing to understand. So misunderstandings that are common here are based on stereotypes and then having lack of perspective and not knowing how they might see things. So change is happening by understanding these stereotypes along the lines of stay-at-home dads where men are staying home. They don't feel like they have to go out and work every day, and they feel like they can focus on being a parent. Where in the past women were expected to be the parent and do all the housework, and that's shifting because now people are starting to see that you can change and things are going to be okay. So a quote about this that I really liked was, \"Men weren't really the enemy--they were fellow victims suffering from an automated masculine mystique that made them feel unnecessarily inadequate when there were no bears to kill.\" So that was by Betty Frieden, and that basically is just talking about how men weren't necessarily trying to be the oppressors. They were more felt like they were supposed to in order to kind of express their masculinity and be what the world told them they had to be, and like kill bears even though there might not have been anything that they really had to do. So in the end, you can kind of look at diversity as a process. So when you're trying to improve diversity, it almost always goes through this cycle. So control is where you look at a group, and you're like, \"Oh, they're not like me. They're savages.\" So then you teach the people around you to hate that group because they're different. But then as like people like, \"Oh, why are we hating them?\" You begin to tolerate them moving forward. So then you start to imitate them because you're like, \"Oh, they actually do some cool things.\" So you start to kind of adopt their culture, and then you redefine it to be more of like a mix. So now as you're starting to adopt, you're like, \"Oh wow, we're not that different.\" So this is kind of like where we begin to adapt and start to accept. So moving on to acceptance. That's when you're like, \"Okay, let's judge them based on their ability and as equals rather than how they're different.\" And then at that point, you forget that they're different at all, and you become one group of people. But then that's when you notice that there's another group of different people, and then the process starts over again. And moving forward, we have to be able to break out of this process and skip step eight and keep moving forward. So that's the end of our presentation. The key thing to take away from this is that it's very important to keep an open mind and be able to think in a future tense in order to not get caught flat-footed and be able to adapt to change and move with the change as it happens moving forward into 2040 and beyond."

The second, far longer entrance route consists of a series of ramps that persons who use wheelchairs must use to access the building. One person about to climb the stairway points a person using a wheelchair towards the ramp, as if to reinforce the separation between persons who do and do not have mobility disabilities.\""

          "en-US": "Julia: Hi we are students from Cohort 9 of the Lockheed Martin Leadership Institute from Miami University’s CEC department. My name is Julia Schaeffer and I am currently a junior at Miami. As an exec in two clubs and a representative on the council of the league of geeks, I’ve been involved in making several meetings and events as accessible and inclusive as possible. \n\nEunice: My name is Eunice Nsaam and I’m also a junior studying Bioengineering. I’m in an exec position for NSBE and EWB chapters at Miami. Being in these positions, I have become more avidly  aware of some of the issues we have in terms of promoting and encouraging inclusivity in our community both locally and at large.\n\nEunice: On this page, we’ll be talking about accessibility in the workplace from an individual perspective to a group perspective in terms of how we can each work on ourselves individually and as a collective in order to create more accessible spaces whether in discussion or implementation of accessible technologies. \n\nJulia: This is something that drew our attention because as we talk about a future of equal opportunities and utilizing all the available knowledge and tools to advance forward, both technologically and socially, extending these ideas to people with disabilities has often been a  very slow process. In an age where there is a far better understanding of the unique differences and  a growing acceptance of those differences, our actions in the workplace among others should be more and more reflective of that, until it is a part of our way of life.\n\nEunice: There are three major categories that we cover: What is Inaccessible, How to be Inclusive, and Why We Care. These categories work together to explain what we believe to be the path that we are on regarding making life more accessible to everyone. By 2040, we expect inclusivity to be the standard, not the exception. \n"
